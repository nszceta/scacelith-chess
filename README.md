[![Built with Claude Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with-Claude%20Code-D97757?logo=claude&logoColor=white)](https://claude.com/claude-code)

A photorealistic chess game played in first person, seated at a waxed wooden table in a sunlit
royal hall, against a porcelain robot driven by Stockfish. Everything is rendered by an in-house
engine written for this game on OpenGL 4.6 (no third-party engine): procedural geometry,
real-time material shaders, physically based lighting.

- **Play** Stockfish 19 at any strength, under tournament rules (touch-move, a chess clock you
  press by hand, a scoresheet you fill in), with an Elo of your own.
- **Coach**: a robot teacher that plays at your level, talks you through the game and shows your
  mistakes on the board, and short challenges (positions of the Lichess puzzle database).
- **Analysis** of your saved games and of any PGN, **Watch a Game** between two Stockfish
  players, and **two players on one PC**.
- **Online**: rated games, challenges and private games on the official server or a community
  one ([scacelith-chess-server](https://github.com/DarkCenobyte/scacelith-chess-server)), or a
  direct match between two computers.
- The interface in 34 languages: English, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian,
  Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish,
  Portuguese (Portugal and Brazil), Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish,
  Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Arabic, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese. The
  coach speaks all of them except Chinese (English with Chinese subtitles).

How to play and every mode and option are described in [docs/GUIDE.md](docs/GUIDE.md).

## Installing

The [releases](https://github.com/DarkCenobyte/scacelith-chess/releases) hold the game for Windows
x64, Linux x86-64 (an archive or an AppImage) and Linux aarch64, and an experimental build for Apple
Silicon Macs; all need a GPU with OpenGL 4.6 (the Mac build brings its own), and Stockfish 19 is
built in.

- **Windows**: unpack `Scacelith-<version>-windows-x64.zip` anywhere and run `Scacelith.exe` (or
  download the executable alone).
- **Linux**: unpack `Scacelith-<version>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` and run `./scacelith`;
  `./install.sh` adds the game to your applications menu (in `~/.local`, no root needed) and
  `./install.sh --uninstall` removes it. It needs glibc 2.34 and OpenSSL 3 (Ubuntu 22.04,
  Debian 12, Fedora 36, RHEL 9 and later), X11 or Wayland with XWayland, and plays its sound
  through ALSA (`libasound2`; PulseAudio and PipeWire through their ALSA plugins). Without
  `libasound2` or a sound device the game runs silent, the coach in subtitles. Saved logins go to
  the desktop's keyring through libsecret (`libsecret-1-0`) when it is installed (a locked keyring
  asks for its password when you sign in or connect), otherwise to a file only you can read: the
  game says so after the sign-in, and Options > Online server can keep them until the game closes
  instead (`install.sh` says when libsecret is missing, and the log says why the file is used).
- **Linux, AppImage**: `Scacelith-<version>-linux-x86_64.AppImage` is the same game in one file
  that runs without unpacking: make it executable (`chmod +x`, or the file's properties) and run
  it. It needs what the archive needs, and FUSE's `fusermount3` or `fusermount` (package `fuse3`
  or `fuse`; libfuse2 is not needed); without them, `--appimage-extract-and-run` runs it from a
  temporary copy. It keeps its settings and files in the same folders as the archive's game.
  AppImageLauncher or Gear Lever, for instance, add it to the applications menu.
- **Linux on 64-bit Arm**: `Scacelith-<version>-linux-aarch64.tar.gz`, the same as above, for an
  aarch64 system with a GPU driver of OpenGL 4.6: NVIDIA (Jetson Orin, discrete cards), AMD
  discrete cards, Asahi Linux on Apple M1/M2. A Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 cannot run it (OpenGL 3.1).
- **macOS (experimental)**: `Scacelith-<version>-macos-arm64-experimental.dmg`, for Apple Silicon
  Macs (M1 or later) with macOS 26 or later; Intel Macs are not supported. Open it and drag
  Scacelith to Applications. macOS offers no OpenGL 4.6, so the app carries Mesa's (Zink on the
  KosmicKrisp Vulkan driver, over Metal); this build is new and less tested than the others. It is
  not signed by a registered Apple developer: the first time, macOS refuses to open it, and
  **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Open Anyway** lets it (or `xattr -dr
  com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Scacelith.app` in a terminal).

## Building

You need CMake 3.21 or later, Ninja, GCC with GNU binutils (tested with GCC 11 and 13; for Windows,
MinGW-w64 GCC with POSIX threads) and Python 3; the Linux build also needs the OpenSSL 3, X11 and
OpenGL development files. Stockfish 19 is in the repository (`third_party/stockfish/`) and is
built with the game. The first configure downloads the coach's voice model (399 MB, from
Supertone's repository on Hugging Face) for the unit tests; `-DSCACELITH_SUPERTONIC_DOWNLOAD=OFF`
does without it.

```sh
# Linux x86-64 or aarch64 (Debian, Ubuntu:
# apt install build-essential cmake ninja-build python3 libssl-dev libx11-dev libgl-dev)
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
ninja -C build                # -> build/scacelith
./build/scacelith_tests

# Windows x64, cross-compiled from Linux
# (apt install g++-mingw-w64-x86-64-posix gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64-posix binutils-mingw-w64-x86-64)
cmake -B build-win -G Ninja -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/mingw-w64-x86_64.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
ninja -C build-win            # -> build-win/Scacelith.exe, self-contained
```

The macOS app (experimental) builds its own Mesa first: see
[tools/macos/README.md](tools/macos/README.md). The build options (`cmake -D<option>=<value>`):

| Option | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `SCACELITH_SF_VARIANTS` | every one | the Stockfish builds to compile, one per instruction set; `x86-64-avx2` (or another one the CPU runs) alone makes a quicker local build |
| `SCACELITH_STOCKFISH` | `ON` | embed Stockfish (`OFF`: a build without the engine, for tests) |
| `SCACELITH_OFFICIAL_SERVER` | `caissa.scacelith.com:443` | the built-in official server, `host[:apiPort[:wsPort]]`; `none` for no official server |
| `SCACELITH_CONSOLE` | `OFF` | Windows: a console executable, which shows the log |
| `SCACELITH_SUPERTONIC_DIR` | | a local copy of the coach's voice model, instead of the download |
| `SCACELITH_SUPERTONIC_DOWNLOAD` | `ON` | download the voice model when no local copy is given |
| `SCACELITH_SUPERTONIC_REQUIRED` | `OFF` | a missing or unverifiable voice model file fails the configure |
| `SCACELITH_SANITIZE` | | a test build with sanitizers, for instance `address,undefined` |
| `SCACELITH_COVERAGE` | `OFF` | Linux, GCC: instrument the game's code for gcov (test coverage) |

[docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) has the details: the Linux aarch64 cross-build, the
tests under Wine and the sanitizers, the X11 desktop tests, the test coverage, the audit tools,
the continuous integration and the releases.

## Command-line options

The game runs without any option. These ones start it in a given way (`Scacelith.exe <options>`
on Windows, `./scacelith <options>` on Linux, `/Applications/Scacelith.app/Contents/MacOS/Scacelith
<options>` on a Mac):

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--lang <code>` | the interface language for this session: `en`, `bg`, `cs`, `da`, `de`, `el`, `es`, `et`, `fi`, `fr`, `hi`, `hr`, `hu`, `id`, `it`, `lt`, `lv`, `nl`, `pl`, `pt`, `pt-BR`, `ro`, `ru`, `sk`, `sl`, `sv`, `tr`, `uk`, `vi`, `ar`, `ja`, `ko`, `zh-Hans` or `zh-Hant` |
| `--ini <file>` | read and write the settings in that file, with the saved logins beside it, instead of the user folder |
| `--calibrate` | the brightness calibration before the title page, as on a first start |
| `--coach-dir <folder>` | read (and download) the coach's voice model in that folder |
| `--start [--human white\|black] [--tc N]` | a game against Stockfish at once, with your colour and the time control (its index in the New game list, from 0) |
| `--start --hotseat` | a game between two players on one PC at once: `--white-name <name>`, `--black-name <name>`, `--rated`, `--handover <seconds>` (0: an instant cut) |
| `--start --coach [--coach-level 0..6] [--coach-colour white\|black]` | a coach game at once (level 0 is the rules lesson) |
| `--start --coach --coach-lesson-chapter <id>` | the rules lesson at once, starting at that chapter (`castling`, `en_passant`, ...: the ids in `src/coach/lesson.cpp`; an unknown one is logged and ignored) |
| `--start --coach --coach-challenge <id> [--coach-challenge-position N]` | a challenge of the Coach page at once (its ids are the `challenge` lines of `assets/coach/challenges/challenges.txt`), at its position N, from 1 |
| `--viewer [--white-preset N] [--black-preset N] [--viewpoint 0..9]` | Watch a Game at once |
| `--analyse <file.pgn> [--game G] [--analysis-at P]` | game G of a PGN file (the first by default) in the Analysis mode, at the position after P plies |
| `--replay <file.pgn> [--game G] [--replay-speed x1\|x2\|x4\|x8\|instant] [--replay-paused]` | the replay at the table of game G of a saved games file |
| `--no-intro` | skip the fade-in before a game |
| `--shot <file.png> [--frames N] [--size WxH] [--warp <seconds>]` | render N frames (30 by default), save the last one as a PNG and quit, leaving the settings and the saved games as they are; `--warp` simulates that many seconds first |
| `--scene <name>`, `--list-scenes` | a viewer scene instead of the game, the list of scenes |
| `--data-dir <folder>` | read the shaders from that folder (**F5** reloads them) instead of the embedded ones |
| `--debug-gl` | an OpenGL debug context |

[docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#development-options) lists the options made for tests
and screenshots (scripted moves, cameras, the UI viewer's screens).

Environment variables:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `SCACELITH_GPU_PROFILE=N` | the time of each rendering pass on the GPU, in the log every N frames |
| `SCACELITH_GL_DISABLE=tessellation,depth_clamp` | treat these driver features as missing (one or both) |
| `SCACELITH_GL_FORCE=tessellation` | keep tessellation on a driver known to draw nothing with it |
| `SCACELITH_AUDIO=null` | no sound output |
| `SCACELITH_ALSA_DEVICE=<device>` | Linux: the ALSA device to play on, instead of `default` |
| `SCACELITH_KEYRING=off` | Linux, macOS: never use the system keyring for the saved logins |
| `SCACELITH_COACH_SOURCE=archive\|official` | the voice model's download from Supertone's archive copy first, or from the official repository without falling back |
| `SCACELITH_EGL_LIBRARY=<path>` | macOS: the libEGL to use when the app's own cannot be loaded |
| `SCACELITH_DUMP_SHADERS=<folder>` | write the preprocessed shader sources into that existing folder |

### Used from the system, not shipped

On Linux the game uses the system's GNU C Library (LGPL-2.1-or-later), OpenSSL 3 (Apache-2.0),
libX11 (MIT/X11), OpenGL library (libglvnd, MIT) and graphics driver, ALSA (libasound,
LGPL-2.1-or-later, loaded at run time) and libsecret (LGPL-2.1-or-later, loaded at run time when
present, with GLib); on Windows, the system's DLLs; on macOS, the system's frameworks and
libraries.

### Downloaded at the player's request

The coach's voice model (Supertonic 3) is not part of the program nor of its release package: the
game downloads Supertone's official, unmodified files from Supertone's repositories on Hugging Face
at the player's request. It has its own licence (BigScience Open RAIL-M), whose use restrictions
the download prompt shows; see
`third_party/supertonic3/README.scacelith.md`.
