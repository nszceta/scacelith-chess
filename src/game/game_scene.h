// The game: main menu over the live hall, new game setup, first-person play against Stockfish
// with tournament rules (touch-move, clock pressed by hand, arbiter), hot-seat play (two people on
// one PC, each from their own robot's eyes, see docs/MULTIPLAYER_PLAN.md), online play (a player
// of the Scacelith server or of a direct match sits in the other chair, see
// game_scene_online.cpp), the viewer mode (two Stockfish players watched from a free, invisible
// camera), the replay of a saved game (game_scene_replay.cpp), the Analysis mode
// (game_scene_analysis.cpp), the player's Elo, animations, audio and UI.
//
// Seats: seat 0 is White's chair (+Z), seat 1 Black's (-Z). Each seat has a controller (Human,
// Stockfish or Remote; a hot-seat game has two Humans), the name and Elo written on the
// scoresheets, its engine settings and its playing hand: the hand on the clock side plays and
// presses the clock, the other one writes. The clock stands at +X in every mode, opposite the
// windows (layout::CLOCK_ON_POSITIVE_X): at White's right, so the player with Black, human or not,
// plays left-handed.
//
// Hot-seat: the seat to move has the mouse and keyboard and the view from its robot's eyes. After
// the clock press (untimed: once the move is made) the view flies to the other player's eyes (or
// cuts through black, Options > Gameplay) with the clock frozen; buttons still held by the
// previous player are ignored until released. Each seat keeps its own look (yaw, pitch, lean).
// The in-game pointer, the square aimed at, the clock hover, the see-through arm and the look at
// the scoresheet (S) belong to the player to move; there is no pointer or aiming while the view
// goes over.
//
// Untimed games (no time control; Play, hot-seat and Watch can be, Coach always is, a replay is
// when its record has no TimeControl or clocks, online never is, see clock_rules.h) have no clock
// press: a move is completed as its last piece is released and the turn passes at once
// (completeMove). The clock shows dashes, its lever stays still.
//
// Coach mode (game_scene_coach.cpp): the human against the coach robot ("COACH" on its chest),
// levels 1-6, or the rules lesson (level 0). Untimed, never rated, touch-move on, illegal
// placements refused. The scene is the coach's coach::Stage (its voice, subtitles, gestures, gaze,
// demonstration moves, takebacks, marks, HUD) and coach::Analyst (the Stockfish analyses); a
// coach::Session decides what the coach says and when (src/coach). The coach's own moves come
// from its teaching repertoire, then Stockfish at the level's strength, and wait while the
// session reviews the player's move (coachMayMove).
//
// Saved games (game_archive.h, game_saving.h): games against Stockfish, coach games of levels 1-6,
// hot-seat games and direct matches go to plat::appDataDirectory() + "pgn/" as PGN files, with the
// time each move took and the clocks, when they end or are left (archiveGame); never server games,
// the viewer mode, the rules lesson or a replay. The title page's "Saved games" lists them.
//
// Replay (game_scene_replay.cpp): a saved game played again by the two robots at the pace it was
// played (replay::ReplayClock), watched like the viewer mode (free camera, viewpoints, the
// players' eyes), its clocks from the record, its scoresheets written as the moves are played,
// its result card at the end. K pauses, J / L step back / forward, Shift+J / Shift+L slower /
// faster, Home / End the start / the end; the same as mouse buttons on the overlay.
//
// Analysis (game_scene_analysis.cpp): a game reviewed by Stockfish (src/analysis), opened from
// the Analysis page, the Saved games page, the online history or the game over card of a game just
// played. A replay the player steps through: one move forward played by a robot, one move back
// taken back by hand, further set at once behind a dip; the evaluation bar and the move list
// (ui::analysisHud), the symbols and better-move arrows on the board (World::submitAnalysisMarks),
// the commentator's comments on the key moments (voice and subtitles). K plays / pauses, J / L one
// move back / forward, Home / End, N the comments, M the voice, B the arrows.
//
// Standing up (anim/stance.h, the rules in stance_control.h): during a game the first-person
// player gets up with the arrow keys (Up: in front of the chair, Left / Right: at that end of the
// table, Down: back in the chair). Only a seated player plays: standing, nothing on the board or
// the clock answers (a notice says to sit down), the scoresheet waits, the clock keeps running.
// The view rides the robot's eyes and aims at the board from wherever it stands. Online the
// opponent sees the robot get up (GameLink::sendStance) and their robot does the same. At the end
// of a game everyone sits back down before the handshake.
