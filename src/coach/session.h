// A Coach-mode game (levels 1-6) or the rules lesson (level 0), seen from the coach: what to say
// and when. The session owns the director and the coach's brain (Reviewer, Appraisal,
// OpeningAnnouncer, Lesson, the event lines) and follows the flows documented in the headers of
// coach/review.h, coach/appraisal.h, coach/openings.h, coach/lesson.h and coach/events.h:
//   - game start: greeting (and the level's introduction), opening names as they are identified;
//   - the human's turn: analysis A0 (and A3 at levels 3-4), background evaluations when idle;
//   - after every move: "Check!" / "Checkmate!"; after the human's move: A1/A2 when needed, the
//     review (verdict, explanation, demonstration, rewind, takeback offer, praise); after the
//     coach's move: its remarks and threat warnings;
//   - the takeback offer's answer, the player's takeback requests, draw answers;
//   - game end: closing words, the handshake (played by the scene), the appraisal (skippable);
//   - level 0: the lesson's chapters, WaitMove judging, illegal-move explanations, idle hints;
//   - a challenge (SessionConfig::challenge): its positions one after the other, the moves judged,
//     hints on request (coach/challenge_run.h), illegal-move explanations as in the lesson.
// Engine-free and GL-free: the world is reached through coach::Stage and coach::Analyst.
