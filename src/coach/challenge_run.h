// One run of a challenge (coach/challenge.h) by the coach: the session (coach/session.h) holds it
// instead of a game when SessionConfig::challenge names a set, and forwards the scene's events.
//
// The flow, position after position:
//   - the set's introduction (ch.intro.<id>) before the first position, "Next position." before
//     the others;
//   - the set-up (SetPosition), the coach's move into it when there is one (PlayMove, by hand), the
//     task ("Mate in 2.", "Find the fork.", "Checkmate my king."), then a WaitMove;
//   - the player's move: a line is judged against the solution at once (ChallengePosition::accepts);
//     a right move gets a nod and the coach's answer from the line, the last one the praise. A
//     play-out move is judged by Stockfish (the position after it, the coach to move): it must keep
//     the win (mate, promote) or the draw (hold); the same analysis gives the coach's reply. A
//     reply that draws on the board (stalemate, no mating material) solves a hold once played,
//     with no wait after it: no position is ever waited in without a move to make;
//   - a wrong move: Stockfish's best answer is played by hand while the coach says it ("Not this
//     one: I'd answer Qxd1."), taken back with the player's move, and the same WaitMove waits again.
//     Every sentence is proved by the board or the engine: "would be checkmate" only when the
//     answer mates on the board, "That's stalemate" only on the board, "it takes longer" only when
//     the engine still sees a mate, longer than the position asks;
//   - hints only on request: the H key (requestHint) at any time the position waits (in a
//     play-out, given once the engine named the move; a move made meanwhile drops the request), or
//     the coach's offer, a question with a card, after every kHintOfferAfter wrong moves at one
//     move when a hint can be given. Step 1 the piece (or the square when that piece is the only
//     one that can move), 2 the square, 3 the move shown by hand (challengeHint);
//   - after the last position, the closing words; then the session wants the handshake.
// Nothing is recorded: no review, no appraisal, no history; the game's moves are the board's only.
