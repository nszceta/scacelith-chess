// What the coach needs from the world around it: the Stage (voice, subtitles, body, table, HUD)
// and the Analyst (Stockfish analyses). The game scene implements both (game_scene_coach.cpp);
// the tests implement fakes. The director and the session (coach/director.h, coach/session.h)
// only talk to the world through these two interfaces, so they stay engine-free and GL-free.
//
// Every call returns at once. Long actions (a gesture, a demonstration move, a rewind) run in the
// scene; the director polls busy() / the voice clock to know when they are over.
