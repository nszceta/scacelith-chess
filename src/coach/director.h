// The director performs coach scripts (coach/script.h) on the Stage: it renders each line twice
// (written for the subtitle, spoken for the voice, same variant), has it synthesised ahead of time,
// plays it, times the gestures and marks on the words they refer to (coach/pacing.h), runs the
// demonstrations and rewinds, and applies the turn-taking rules:
//   - Urgent beats go before everything queued and cut a running Normal/Low line at its next
//     pause at a punctuation mark (comma, colon, dash or sentence end; a pause of the synthesised
//     audio);
//   - Normal and Low beats queue behind beats of the same or a higher priority;
//   - Low beats are dropped when stale (their ply is more than two plies old) or once the player
//     acts (playerActed);
//   - Space skips the running skippable beat and the skippable beats of the same script after it
//     (skipCurrent(): the running beat only, and of a demonstration move only its narration); a
//     Rewind is never skipped, it only goes faster; a SetPosition or PlayMove is never skipped
//     (what follows stands on the board it leaves).
// Engine-free and GL-free: the world is reached through coach::Stage only.
