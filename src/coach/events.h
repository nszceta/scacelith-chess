// assets/coach/speech/<lang>/events.lang; the director performs it like any other script.
// Check, checkmate and praise of good moves belong to the review (review.lang).
//
// Gaze rule: these lines are about the game with the player, so the coach looks at the player
// (with a nod or an open palm), except the thinking filler, said while looking at the position.
