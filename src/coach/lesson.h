// Level 0: the interactive rules lesson. Twelve chapters of scripted beats
// (coach/script.h): the coach sets up small positions, explains, points, demonstrates, and waits
// for the player's move (WaitMove) that an Expectation judges. A wrong move is answered and taken
// back, an illegal one is refused and explained (why it is illegal, computed from the position),
// and the help escalates: a hint with pointing on the second failure, a demonstration of the
// solution on the third. The lesson never fails and is never recorded (no scoresheet, no clock,
// no rating, no end-of-game flow; touch-move relaxed: see the integrator notes in lesson.cpp).
//
// Engine-free: every chess fact comes from chess::Position.
