// Audio: software mixer with procedurally synthesised sounds (no sample files), hall reverb and
// 3D panning. Backends (backend.h): WASAPI shared mode (Windows), ALSA (Linux, libasound loaded at
// run time), null (no device, or SCACELITH_AUDIO=null: real-time pace, output discarded, or
// streamed to a WAV file when SCACELITH_AUDIO_DUMP=<path.wav> is set).
// Implemented by the audio work package. Thread-safe API (the mixer runs on its own thread):
// play/playUI/setListener/volumes may be called from any thread at any time. play/playUI are no-ops
// before init(); setListener and the volume/ambience setters (setVoiceVolume too) are stored and
// apply from the first block. init() and shutdown() must not race with the other calls.
//
// Signal flow (mixer thread, 48 kHz or the device rate, float stereo):
//   voices (32, 3D: inverse distance with 0.15 m min distance, equal-power pan, ITD, head
//   shadow, behind/air low-pass) + speech (2, same 3D chain, talker directivity) + ambience
//   (ducked under speech) -> hall (image-source early reflections + 16-line FDN, both derived
//   from the hall's geometry and materials: room.h, reverb.h) -> master volume -> DC blocker ->
//   look-ahead limiter (threshold -1.4 dBFS, soft ceiling below -1.0 dBFS).
// Every one-shot is synthesised (modal/noise models) by a low-priority builder thread into a
// small pool of variants per Sfx; each trigger additionally randomises pitch (+-3 %), level and
// tone, and the variant just played is re-synthesised with a new seed, so no two plays match.
