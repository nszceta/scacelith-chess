// returns StartReplay on Replay ('library.replay' then names the game; no such entry when

// the saved games to choose from, a PGN pasted from the clipboard, the online history when signed
// in; its Analyse returns StartAnalysis ('library.replay' names the game, or holds its PGN text).

// the view; the HUD is mouse driven, the keyboard is the game's):
//   - left edge: the evaluation bar, the whole height of the window but its margins, White's part
//     light and Black's dark, the boundary gliding to each new value, the figure ("+1.3", "M3")
//     written at the end of the side that leads;
//   - right edge: a panel with the players, the result and the opening, the move list (numbered
//     rows, White's and Black's moves side by side, figurine notation, each move followed by its
//     symbol in the symbol's colour; the move that led to the position on the board highlighted
//     and kept in view; the wheel scrolls it; a click on a move goes to the position after it).
//     Every move's cell carries, very discreetly in its background, the evaluation bar as it stood
//     after that move: its light and dark parts and their boundary, in the same orientation;
//   - under the list: the review's summary (each side's accuracy and its ??, ?, ?! counts) once
//     known, the review's progress while it runs, and the controls: start, one move back,
//     play / pause, one move forward, end, then the toggles of the comments, of the voice and of
//     the arrows (icon buttons with tooltips naming their keys).
