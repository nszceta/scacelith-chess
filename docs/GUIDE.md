# Playing Scacelith

How to play, the game's modes and its options. Installing the game, building it and its
command-line options are in the [README](../README.md).

## Playing

- **Left click** on one of your pieces: your hand reaches for it. Tournament rules apply: a piece
  you touch must be moved if it has a legal move (touch-move).
- **Left click** on a square: the piece is played there. Captured pieces are put beside the board.
  You can also drag: press on the piece, release on the square. While a piece is in hand, the
  square under the pointer is outlined on the board, your own pieces never get in the way of the
  pointer (it looks through them at the square behind), and your arm turns see-through.
- **Space**, or a click on the chess clock: your hand presses the clock. A move is only completed
  once the clock is pressed, and after a promotion the new piece must be on the board first.
  With Options > Gameplay > Auto-press clock your hand presses it by itself once the move is on
  the board (capture, castling rook and promotion piece included); online, the server (or the
  host of a direct match) decides for each game. A game without a time limit ("No clock") has no
  clock press at all, for both sides and in every mode: the move is completed as its last piece
  is released (FIDE 4.7), the turn passes at once, and the clock shows dashes.
- **Right mouse button** (hold and drag): look around from your chair. The pointer at the top of
  the window: look up at your opponent. **Mouse wheel**: lean towards the board. **Middle click**
  or **C**: look at the board again.
- **S**: look at your own scoresheet, lying out of sight beside you, and back (**S** again,
  **C** or a look around).
- **Up arrow**: stand up in front of your chair and look down at the board. **Left / Right
  arrow**: walk round to that end of the table (your own left and right) and look at the board
  from the side; the arrows take you from one spot to another without sitting down. **Down
  arrow**: sit back down. You can get up on either player's turn once your hand is free (not
  with a piece in hand). Only a seated player plays: standing, you cannot touch a piece or press
  the clock, your scoresheet waits, and the clock keeps running. The look around, the lean and
  **C** still work. At the end of a game everyone sits back down for the handshake. Online, your
  opponent sees your robot get up, and you see theirs.
- **Tab**: move list. **Esc**: menu (offer or claim a draw, resign, options).

At the table the game draws its own pointer, which shows what a click will do: a gold ring over a
piece you can touch or over the clock, a sight with a gold centre over a square the piece in hand
can go to (Options > Gameplay > Game pointer switches back to the system arrow).

A new game asks for the opponent's strength (Stockfish presets, or custom Skill Level / Elo /
depth / move time / nodes) and the time control (unlimited, 1+0, 3+0, 3+2, 5+0, 5+3, 10+0, 10+5,
15+10, 30+0, 30+20, 90+30, or custom with increment and delay). Your colour is random for the
first game, then alternates. Every physical action (touching, moving, capturing, promoting,
pressing the clock) takes exactly the same time for both players, and each clock only stops when
the lever is actually pressed.

Stockfish runs on your computer. With **Realistic thinking time** (Options > Gameplay, on by
default) it takes about as long over a move as a human of its strength would with its clock: longer
for the stronger presets and the longer time controls, a few seconds per move for the weak presets
in rapid. Its search itself stops within a second, except at full strength (Stockfish Max), which
manages its clock as Stockfish does. The New Game and Watch a Game pages say which way it plays and
where to change it. **Dynamic Elo by time** (off by default) makes it play weaker when its own
clock runs low, as people do: a little from the last minute (in rapid and blitz games earlier, from
a fifth of the base time but at most 3 minutes; in bullet from half of it; each second of increment
counts ten times), up to 150 Elo below its level at 15 seconds, then much weaker in time trouble,
up to 400 Elo below with an empty clock (Stockfish Max only in the last seconds). It applies to
timed games only and does not change the opponent's rating.

Illegal moves are only possible when legal-move hints are turned off (Options > Gameplay). As in
tournaments, the arbiter then restores the position, gives the opponent extra time, and a second
illegal move loses the game.

### Scoresheets

As in tournaments, both players record the game on their own scoresheet, a pad lying on the side
of the table opposite the clock. Right after every clock press each player writes the move down
with the hand on the pad side, while the other hand stays free to play and press the clock, so
keeping score never costs clock time. The clock always stands on the side of the table away from
the windows, its displays facing them so that the daylight falls on them: the player with Black,
who has it on their left, therefore plays with the left hand and writes with the right. The header is filled in when the game starts (event
"Scacelith", date, round, the players' names and ratings: your name from Options > Player,
"Human" by default (translated with the interface), and "Stockfish"), a full page of 40 moves is turned over the top of the pad,
and the result is written before the final handshake. You hear the pen on the paper and the page
being turned.

Each player has a handwriting of their own (Caveat, Marck Script or Bad Script for Latin and
Cyrillic; names in other scripts are written in Aref Ruqaa, Klee One or LXGW WenKai), and moves use
the piece letters of the interface language.

### Your Elo

Your rating is computed after every game against Stockfish as FIDE computes tournament ratings
(FIDE Rating Regulations, 2024), with the same rules as the online server's:

- **First rating.** You start unrated, shown at 1500. Your first five games give your first
  rating, FIDE's way: the average of your opponents' ratings, counting two extra draws against
  1800-rated players, plus FIDE's rating difference for your score (for example five draws against
  1500-rated opponents give 1586, five wins 1895). A first rating is at most 2200. As FIDE
  ignores a newcomer's first event without a point, the games you lose before your first draw
  or win do not count towards it.
- **Then** each game changes your rating by K × (score − expected score), where the expected
  score comes from FIDE's table for the rating difference (counted as 400 points at most): K = 40
  for your first 30 counted games (those of your first rating included, not the losses before
  your first draw or win; the rating is provisional until then), 20 afterwards, 10 once you have
  reached 2400. A rating never drops below 100.

The opponent's rating is the preset's (Novice 800 up to Stockfish Max 3500; a custom opponent is
rated from its Skill Level or UCI Elo). A game counts once both players have moved; leaving a
game, or closing the game, resigns it. The title page shows your rating, record and peak, the new
game page the score you can expect against the selected opponent, and the game over card the
change (`Elo 1512 → 1524 (+12)`). Watched games are never rated. Games are rated one by one, where
FIDE rates a month's games together.

### Two players on one PC

Set **Opponent** to **Human, same PC** on the new game page to play a friend at the same computer,
each from their own robot's eyes. The page asks for both names (White defaults to your name from
Options > Player, Black to "Player 2"), each player's handwriting, the time control and whether
the game is rated (the player with Black, who has the clock on their left, plays with the left
hand). **Swap colours** exchanges the two players.

- The player to move has the mouse and the keyboard, with the same rules as against Stockfish
  (touch-move, pressing the clock by hand, the arbiter, the claims in the Esc menu).
- Once the clock is pressed (without a clock: once the move is made), the camera flies over the
  table into the other player's eyes, and both clocks stand still until it lands. Options >
  Gameplay > Hot-seat handover sets the flight length (0.8 to 2 s) or an instant cut through
  black. Buttons still held when the view leaves are ignored until released, and each player
  keeps their own look (right drag, wheel).
- Each player fills in their own scoresheet in their own handwriting. The mover writes the move at
  once; the next player writes it when the view reaches them, or after their own move if they
  touch a piece first.
- **Esc** offers a draw (it goes with your next move, as in FIDE 9.1.2: the opponent sees an
  accept / decline card when the view reaches them, and touching a piece declines it), claims a
  draw, or resigns for the player to move, confirmed with their name.
- The top left corner shows both names (and ratings); a caption names the player whose turn begins.
  The game over card names the winner, and the rematch swaps the colours (the clock follows its
  player, so each keeps the same hand).

A two-player game is friendly by default and never changes your rating against Stockfish. A rated
one keeps a separate rating per name (`[local_player_N]` in the settings file; a new name starts
unrated at 1500, with the same FIDE rules), updated for both players against each other's rating
before the game (a game between two unrated names counts for both, unless it is lost by a name
that has not drawn or won yet: FIDE then ignores it for both); leaving a game early rates
nothing.

## Coach

**Coach** on the title page seats you in front of a robot with "COACH" on its chest, a teacher
who plays you at your level and talks you through the game. The Coach page chooses the level and
your colour (White, Black, or alternating from one game to the next); the choice is remembered
(`[coach]` in the settings file).

- **The rules of chess** (level 0) is an interactive lesson, always with White: the coach sets up
  small positions and shows how each piece moves and captures, then castling, promotion, check
  and checkmate, the habit of looking before every move and the first rules of the opening, and
  you try each idea on the board. Legal-move hints are on, touch-move is relaxed (a piece can be
  put back), nothing is written down; leaving it resumes at the same chapter next time.
- **Levels 1 to 6** (from *First steps* to *Expert*) are real games against the coach's Stockfish
  at that strength, with its teaching repertoire in the opening. The lower the level, the plainer
  the words; levels 0 to 2 show the board's coordinates. There is no clock, the game is never
  rated, the scoresheets name the coach with its level's rating, and touch-move and the hints
  option apply as in a normal game.
- After your move the coach may say what it saw: a threat, a good move, a mistake. It points at
  the pieces and squares it talks about, which light up in blue on the board, and it can show a
  line by playing it with its own hand, then put the pieces back. A line never leaves a bigger
  piece en prise to take a smaller one; when the coach plays another move first (a check, a
  capture, a threat), it wins at least as much back, and says so when the bigger piece only has to
  wait. At levels 1 to 3 it plays the whole sequence, down to the piece lost or the mate, and says
  what it cost; from level 4 it plays up to where the problem stands and points at what falls
  next. Where you could take back but that fails, it says why ("if you take back with Qxd2, Qxh1
  takes your rook"). A reason is given only when the board proves it (the material really lost for
  good, beyond what the best move loses, and enough to explain the mistake) and a second, deeper
  search confirms the line move by move, else the coach only names the better move; among moves
  as good as each other, it names the most natural one (a capture, the move a player would look at
  first). For a blunder whose reason it cannot prove, it says that it is a blunder
  and which piece had a better move (and that the move wins material, when it plainly does), and
  offers the takeback without giving the move away: it names the move if you play on, and says so
  if you find it. A move that costs a little is called
  a small slip, never a mistake with a made-up line. Praise goes to a move that mattered: not to
  one of several moves as good as each other, nor to a small gain in a game already won or lost.
  At levels 1 and 2 the coach also looks for its own threats with a search after each of its moves:
  it holds back a warning when the search finds that the threat wins nothing, and when your move
  then loses to a threat it found, it says that you did not answer it. A mistake (less than a
  blunder) is explained in words only, without playing the line: the coach then plays its own
  move, and you answer it. After a blunder it has shown, it offers to take
  your move back: **Take back** or
  **Backspace** accepts, **Play on** or touching one of your pieces declines. At levels 4 to 6 these
  takebacks are counted, 5, 3 and 2 a game: only the offers you accept use one (never the offer
  after a mate allowed or missed, nor the menu's own takeback), and "Takebacks left" in the bottom
  corner, under the key hints, and on the offer card shows how many remain. Once they are used up,
  the coach says so, once, and offers no more takebacks in that game. When it shows a line without
  that offer (a game you still clearly win, the level's takebacks used up), it says that its own
  move comes next once the pieces are back. What counts as a game already decided, or as you
  still clearly ahead, depends on the level: the lower the level, the bigger the advantage it
  takes, as players of that level turn an advantage into a win less surely. The coach then keeps
  pointing out what a move gives away in a game a strong player would win anyway, and offers the
  takeback more often.
- **Space** skips what the coach is saying. **Esc** opens the menu: take back my move (your last
  move and the coach's reply, as long as neither scoresheet has written them), offer or claim a
  draw, resign, options, main menu (abandons the game).
- At the end the coach says a word on the game, shakes your hand and sums the game up; the end
  card offers to play again at the same level. When the coach suggests another level, the Coach
  page proposes it next time.

The Coach page has two tabs: **Training** (the games above) and **Challenges**, short sets of
positions that each train one skill without a whole game: mates in one, two and three, back-rank
mates and mating patterns; free pieces, forks, pins, skewers, discovered attacks, deflection,
in-between moves, trapped pieces, promotion, quiet moves and opening traps; finding the escape of
your king and the only defensive move; and the basic endgames, played out against the coach
(queen or rook and king against king, king and pawn, stopping a pawn with your king alone, the
Lucena and Philidor rook endings, endgame tactics). You always play White; the coach sets each
position up, plays the move that leads to it when it comes from a real game, and says what to
find. A wrong move stays on the board while the coach shows its answer, then both go back and you
try again. The coach never gives a hint you did not ask for: press **H** at any time for one (the
piece to play, then the square to look at, then the move itself, shown by hand), and after a few
wrong tries it asks whether you would like one (**Hint** or **H** accepts, **No, thanks** or
touching a piece keeps looking). Nothing of a challenge is saved, no game, no rating: a green
check on the Coach page marks the sets you have completed. The line positions come from the
Lichess puzzle database, each checked with the game's Stockfish.

The coach speaks with a voice synthesised on your computer (Supertonic 3). Its model is not part of
the game: the first time you open the Coach page (or switch Options > Audio > Coach voice on), the
game offers to download it (Supertone's official release, about 399 MB) from Supertone's repository
on Hugging Face (or, if that fails, from Supertone's archive copy there) into the game's folder of
application data: `%APPDATA%\scacelith\coach\` on Windows, `$XDG_DATA_HOME/scacelith/coach/` (by
default `~/.local/share/scacelith/coach/`) on Linux.
The prompt shows the model's licence (OpenRAIL-M) and its use restrictions; "Not now" switches the
coach's voice off. A small panel in the corner shows the download while you keep playing, and an
interrupted download continues where it stopped. If you have the 8-bit version of the model that
earlier versions of the game downloaded, the coach keeps speaking with it: the game offers the
official version once at start-up, and later from the Voice model row of Options > Audio (the old
files are deleted first). Without the model, with Coach voice off, or without a sound device, the
coach speaks through subtitles only. Options > Audio > Subtitles shows
its words at the bottom of the screen (Automatic: when it does not speak the language of the menus,
as with Chinese menus where it speaks English), and Options > Audio > Voice volume sets its volume.
Options > Audio > Voice quality sets how many refinement steps each line takes, from Low (4) to
Maximum (9), Medium (5) by default: a higher level gives a slightly cleaner voice and takes longer
to compute, so the coach starts each line a little later. It is greyed out until a voice model is
installed. `[tts]` in the settings file tunes the synthesis: `threads` (0 = 2),
`voice` (-1 = the default voice), `steps` (the voice quality) and `arch` (`auto`, or `avx512`,
`avxvnni`, `avx2`, `sse2`, `scalar` when troubleshooting; `neon`, `scalar` on ARM).

## Watch a Game

**Watch a Game** on the title page lets two Stockfish players (one preset per side, and a time
control) play each other while you move freely around the hall, invisible to them. The choice is
remembered (`[viewer]` in the settings file).

- **W A S D** or **Z Q S D** (AZERTY) or the arrows: move along the view. **E / Space** and
  **C / Ctrl** (or Page Up / Down): up and down. **Shift**: three times faster.
- **Right mouse button** (hold and drag): look around. **Mouse wheel**: movement speed.
- **1 – 9**: fly to a viewpoint (beside the table, above the board, the hall, the clock, White's
  face, Black's face, the duel, the windows, the tapestries). **0**: through the eyes of the player
  to move; after each move the camera flies over the table into the other player's eyes.
- **Tab**: move list. **H**: hide the controls. **Esc**: menu (resume, options, main menu).

The players claim and offer draws like the opponent of a normal game (repetition, fifty moves, an
equal position late in the game), and the game over card offers to watch another game. **Dynamic
Elo by time** under the time controls weakens both players when their clocks run low, as in a
game against Stockfish.

## Analysis

**Analysis** on the title page lists your saved games with the PGN files put in their folder
(the page says where; **Open folder** shows it), and **Paste a PGN** analyses a game copied as
PGN text (the first one when the clipboard holds several). When you are signed in, **My online
games** opens your history on the server, where each game's page has **Analyse** too, as does
**Saved games** next to Replay and the game over card (**Analyse the game**: after a game against
Stockfish, the coach, a friend on the same PC or online; it declines a rematch).

The game is set on the table (its starting position; its final one after **Analyse the game**) and
Stockfish reviews it in the background, first quickly (the bar and the symbols appear within
seconds), then in depth; a game opened again shows its review at once (the evaluations are kept for
the 200 games last analysed, in the game's folder of application data, `analysis\`).

- **The evaluation bar** on the left shows who stands better in the position on the board, with the
  score (or the mate) at the leading side's end.
- **The move panel** on the right lists the moves with their symbols: **!!** brilliant, **!** the
  only good move, **!?** interesting, **?!** inaccuracy, **?** mistake, **??** blunder. Behind each
  move, a faint band shows where the bar stood after it. Under the moves, each side's accuracy and
  count of each symbol. Click a move to go to the position after it: the next or the previous move
  is played (or taken back) by the robots' hands; further away, the board is set at once.
- **On the board**, the square a move landed on carries its symbol on a coloured disc, and after an
  inaccuracy, a mistake or a blunder a green arrow shows the better move.
- **Comments** on the key moments (the opening, the mistakes and what they allowed or missed, the
  brilliant and only moves, the end and each side's accuracy) are spoken by the coach's voice when
  its model is installed, and shown as subtitles. A comment names a fork, an unprotected piece or
  the material a line wins only when that material is lost for good (not traded back) and the best
  move would not have lost it too. Opening an analysis with the voice on but its model missing
  offers the download once, unless the Coach page or the options offered it before.
- **K** (or the play button): play the game on, move by move, pausing for the comments. **J / L**:
  one move back / forward. **Home / End**: the start / the end. **N**: comments on or off. **M**:
  voice on or off (subtitles only). **B**: arrows on or off. These choices are remembered
  (`[analysis]` in the settings file).
- The camera is free as when watching a game (**W A S D**, the mouse, **0 – 9** for the
  viewpoints, **H** hides the controls and the panels). **Esc**: menu; the main menu goes back to
  the page the analysis was chosen on.

## Online play

**Play Online** on the title page plays people through a Scacelith server, still in the first
person: your opponent sits in the other chair as a robot that moves with them, live: it takes the
piece they touch, holds it over the square they aim at, looks where they look and leans in when
they do.

- **Server.** The official server is `caissa.scacelith.com` (port 443, secure web API and
  secure WebSocket on the same port). Options > Online server > Custom server takes a community
  server instead: host (domain or IP), HTTPS/API port, WSS port (empty = the API port) and, for a
  server with a self-signed certificate, its **Certificate fingerprint (SHA-256)** as its owner
  gives it (64 hexadecimal characters, colons allowed; empty = the Windows certificate store).
  **Test connection** shows the server's name, message and whether it runs a compatible
  version. Google sign-in works only when the server is added under the public host name and API
  port its owner gives. You sign in separately on each server: an account and its sign-in are
  never shared between servers, and nothing secret is written to `Scacelith.ini`.
- **Account.** Sign in with your user name or e-mail and password (and the code of your
  authenticator app once two-factor authentication is on), or with Google. New accounts confirm
  their e-mail address (the page can send the link again); a forgotten password is reset by
  e-mail. The account page lists your rating in every time control (`1500?` while it is
  provisional, with games and wins / draws / losses), changes the password, turns two-factor
  authentication on (QR code or key, then ten recovery codes shown once) or off, makes new
  recovery codes, and signs you out here or everywhere.
- **Finding a game.** Pick a time control (your rating in each is under it), rated or casual, and
  **Find opponent**: a card counts the waiting time and shows the rating range searched. You can
  also challenge a player by name (any time control; only the official ones can be rated, with
  the colour you want), or create a private game whose short code a friend enters to play you.
  Challenges you receive appear as a card wherever you are in the menus, and at the table
  between two games.
- **At the table.** You can only let go of a piece on a legal square. When the server lets the
  robots press the clock (its default; in a direct match, the host's choice), the move is sent the
  moment you choose it, and the robot hand then places the piece and presses the clock. Otherwise
  a notice says so at the start of the game: the robot places the piece, you press the clock
  (Space or a click), and the move goes at the press. The opponent's robot plays their move from
  where their hand is, and its head follows theirs unless Options > Gameplay > Ignore opponent's
  head movements is on (the robot then looks around by itself, as against Stockfish; it still
  moves the pieces with them). The clocks are the server's (they never stop, not even in the Esc
  menu). The ping to the server is in the top right corner. Esc: offer or claim a draw, resign,
  abort before your first move, report the opponent, leave (which resigns, or aborts before your
  first move; closing the window does the same). If your opponent loses
  the connection a banner counts down the time they have to come back; if yours drops, the game
  waits behind a "Reconnecting…" veil and picks up where the server is. The scoresheets are headed
  with the server's name, "Online", the time control, rated or casual, both players with their
  ratings and the game's number; the game over card shows the rating change and offers a rematch.
- **Direct match.** Two computers play each other directly, without a server or an account
  (friendly games, never rated): one player **hosts** (time control, colour, port 47100 by
  default, opened on the home router with UPnP when possible) and reads the address, the port and
  a code (`XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`) to the other, who **joins** with them. The page says whether the
  router opened the port, when to forward it by hand, and when the internet provider shares the
  address (carrier-grade NAT: try IPv6 or a VPN).

Anyone can run a server: see [DarkCenobyte/scacelith-chess-server](https://github.com/DarkCenobyte/scacelith-chess-server). The game speaks
the realtime protocol v1 with it, whose specification is kept in this repository too, in
[protocol/](../protocol/README.md).

Development: `--online-mock` replaces the network with an in-process fake server and a fake
direct-match friend (any password works; see `src/game/online_mock.h` for the inputs that try
error paths), and `--start-online [category]` goes straight to a game (with `--online-mock` the
opponent is a random mover whose hands and head move like a player's; `--online-manual-clock`
leaves the clock press to the players, `--mock-stance standing|side-left|side-right` keeps the
opponent standing, and `--play e2e4,...` makes your moves). In a mock game F9 makes the opponent
disconnect for a while, F10 drops your own connection and F11 makes the opponent stand, go to an
end of the table or sit (in turn). `--scene ui
--ui-screen online-play` (and the other `online-*` and `direct-*` screens listed in
`src/ui/ui_viewer.cpp`) shows the pages on the fake server.
[ONLINE_CLIENT.md](ONLINE_CLIENT.md) describes the client side. QR codes are drawn with
Nayuki's [QR Code generator](https://www.nayuki.io/page/qr-code-generator-library) (MIT licence,
`third_party/qrcodegen/`).

## Options

Settings are stored in `Scacelith.ini` in `%APPDATA%\scacelith\` (on Linux
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/scacelith/`, by default `~/.config/scacelith/`), with the saved logins
(`Scacelith.credentials`) and the log (`scacelith.log`). Their session tokens are encrypted for the
Windows account; on Linux the desktop's keyring keeps them (GNOME Keyring, KWallet or another
Secret Service, through libsecret when it is installed; a locked keyring is unlocked through the
desktop's own prompt when you sign in, connect or sign out, and a dismissed prompt is not shown
again until the next sign-in or start), or, without a keyring or while it stays locked, the file
itself in the clear, readable by its owner only (0600 in a 0700 folder, repaired when more open;
"Remember my sign-in when the system keyring is unavailable" off in Options > Online server: in
memory until the game closes; [ONLINE_CLIENT.md](ONLINE_CLIENT.md#where-the-sessions-are-kept)). A `Scacelith.ini` next to the executable
makes a portable install (versions up to 1.0.0-beta.1 put it there): the game then keeps all three
in the executable's folder, as it also does when the user folder cannot be written. A file given with `--ini <file>` is read and written there only, with the
logins beside it (the log warns when it cannot be written). All of them are
editable from the Options page: display mode and resolution, V-sync, render scale, graphics
quality (a preset, or each effect on its own), brightness, volumes, ambience, legal-move hints,
auto-press clock, the opponent's head movements, mouse sensitivity, the game pointer, and the
hand-over between the two players of a game on one PC (a camera flight, or an instant cut). An
option marked with a small circled **i** after its name has a definition: rest the pointer on the
name or on the mark, or keep the keyboard focus on the row for a moment, to read it.

- **Graphics quality** (Options > Graphics): **Quality** picks a preset, from **Very low** (every
  effect off, for modest graphics cards) through Low, Medium and High (the default) to **Ultra**
  (every option at its maximum). Below it, shadows, reflections, ambient occlusion, indirect
  light, light shafts, tessellation, anti-aliasing, depth of field, motion blur and bloom are set
  one by one: changing one shows the preset that matches, or **Custom**, the player's own mix.
  The render scale (Options > Display) lowers the cost of everything at once. A settings file of
  an older version keeps its quality, as Custom when it had turned the motion blur or the depth
  of field off. To see what each rendering pass costs on a graphics card, start the game with
  `SCACELITH_GPU_PROFILE=60` in the environment: the log gives each pass's time every 60 frames.

- **Auto-press clock** (Options > Gameplay, off by default): your robot presses the clock by
  itself once your move is on the board. In online games the server decides, and in a direct
  match the player who hosts it (**Auto-press clock** on the Host a game page, on by default).
- **Ignore opponent's head movements** (Options > Gameplay, off by default): in online games and
  direct matches the opponent's robot looks where its player looks; with this option it moves
  its head by itself, as against Stockfish.

In the forms of the menus (signing in, creating an account, the account's changes, names, server
settings), **Tab** goes to the next field and starts typing there (**Shift+Tab** the previous one),
and **Enter** goes on to the next field too, or in the last one sends the form, as its main button
would: type the password, press Enter, and you are signed in.

The first start opens on a brightness calibration: three squares, black on the left, mid grey and
white on the right, each with a black knight, drawn exactly as the 3D hall would show them at the
brightness of the slider. Move the slider until the knight on the black square is barely visible,
or no longer visible, and **Continue** (Esc keeps the current value); Options > Graphics >
Brightness changes it later. Until Continue or Esc, every start opens on it: a first start closed
during the loading, or a first run straight into a game, shows it the next time (screenshot runs
never do). `--calibrate` opens the page again, and the UI viewer shows it with
`--scene ui --ui-screen calibration`.

The interface speaks 34 languages: English, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian,
Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish,
Portuguese (Portugal and Brazil), Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish,
Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Arabic (laid out right to left), Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese and
Traditional Chinese. The coach speaks each of them in its own voice, except Chinese (English, with
Chinese subtitles); Brazilian Portuguese is read by the Portuguese voice. The first start follows
the system language; Options > Display > Language changes it at once (click the language box for
the whole list). Options > Player holds your
name and the handwriting in which you fill in your scoresheet, with a preview. Translations live
in `assets/i18n/<code>.lang` (one `key = text` per line, English is the reference and the
fallback); `--lang <code>` overrides the language for one session.
