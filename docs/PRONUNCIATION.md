# Coach voice: pronunciation notes

The coach speaks through Supertonic 3 (`src/tts`). The voice reads the text it is given and sometimes
misreads it: a silent letter said aloud, a stress on the wrong syllable, a short word swallowed. The
speech catalog fixes this in the spoken text only, the subtitles keeping the normal spelling. This page
keeps what was found per language, so that new lines and translations avoid the same traps.

## How a correction is written

- `key.spoken` in `assets/coach/speech/<code>/*.lang`: what the voice says instead of a line (digits
  and file letters in words, a respelled word in that line only).
- `respell.<word> = <spoken>` in `common.lang`: the word is replaced in every spoken line of the
  language, whole words in any case ("Mat !" keeps its capital). `respell.<word>.pause` replaces it only
  before a pause (punctuation or the end of the line; a hyphen joining the next word is no pause). The
  spoken form is one word too (no space or hyphen; the unit test below counts it as one): a number said
  with hyphens goes in `number.<n>.spoken` instead (Danish `to-og-tyve`). See `src/coach/catalog.h`.
- Opening texts are generated: `tools/gen_opening_lang.py` spells squares with `FILE_WORDS` and
  `RANK_WORDS` and respells words with `SPOKEN_WORDS`; run it again after a change (`--check` tells
  whether the files are up to date). The respell.* keys apply to the opening lines too.
- A Russian or Ukrainian stress mark is the combining acute U+0301 after the vowel ("коня́"): the voice
  follows it. Write it in spoken text only.
- The unit test `coach_catalog_every_respelling_in_sentences` checks every `respell.*` word on the
  lines of its language that hold it (said respelled, the subtitles unchanged), and on a sentence of its
  own while no line holds it.

The quality setting (flow-matching steps) does not change a reading: the text encoder and the duration
predictor decide what is said, the steps only refine the sound. Same misreadings at 5 and 9 steps.

## How to check a reading

- `tools/tts_pronunciation.py --model DIR --probe "fr:six=sisse|sixe|si"` synthesises a form and its
  candidate readings with several noise seeds and ranks the candidates by acoustic distance (DTW on
  log-mel spectrograms): the closest is how the voice reads the form. Listen to the `--wav` files on a
  close call.
- A round trip catches what nobody thought to probe: synthesise the lines, transcribe them with an
  offline speech recogniser and compare. Used here: NVIDIA Parakeet TDT 0.6b v3 (sherpa-onnx, int8) for
  English, French, German, Spanish, Russian and Ukrainian; Whisper medium for Arabic and Japanese. The
  recogniser has its own habits (it writes "e4" for "е четыре", hears homophones, guesses from context):
  a word counts as misread when it fails over several seeds and a respelled variant fixes it.
  sherpa-onnx's Whisper drops the tokens that hold part of a UTF-8 character: most kanji and some
  Arabic letters vanish from its transcripts ("الضغط" comes out "الغط"). Give it a tokens file whose
  tokens are the hex of their bytes and decode the text from hex afterwards.
- Both recognisers come from the `asr-models` release of sherpa-onnx on GitHub
  (`sherpa-onnx-nemo-parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8`, `sherpa-onnx-whisper-medium`); `pip install sherpa-onnx`
  runs them. A line with `{best}` or `{move}` is checked with a piece move and a pawn move in its place
  ("rook a3", "e4"): a pawn move puts a lone file letter after the word before it.
- Stress (Russian, Ukrainian): synthesise the plain word and one variant per vowel with U+0301 after
  it; the variant closest to the plain rendering is where the voice puts the stress. Compare with a
  dictionary (espeak-ng's is wrong for many Ukrainian words; check the doubtful ones by hand).
- A final consonant said or not (French "coup", "six"): count the stop closures (silences of 20 ms or
  more, 30 dB under the peak) over many seeds, against a control word without the consonant ("cou").

## French

| Written | Voice said | Spoken spelling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| six, dix (before a pause) | "sixe", "dixe" (with a k) | `sisse`, `disse` (respell.*.pause) |
| huit (before a pause) | "hui" | `huite` (respell.huit.pause) |
| a square's 6 and 8 (e6, a8) | "sixe", "hui", even before a word | `sisse`, `huite` (rank.*.spoken) |
| dix-sept, dix-huit, dix-neuf (and 77-79, 97-99) | "dixe-sept", "dixe-neuf" | `di-sept`, `dize-huit`, `dize-neuf` |
| dix-neuvième (opening texts) | "dixe-neuvième" | `dize-neuvième` (SPOKEN_WORDS) |
| coup | sometimes "coupe" before a vowel ("au coup un") | `cou` |
| mat, pat | "mât", "pas" | `matte`, `patte` |
| the file letter e | too short ("c'est e quatre" heard "cé quatre"); "eu" read like "u" | `euh` |

"six" and "dix" before the noun they count are fine ("six coups", "dix erreurs"), as is "huit coups"
(silent t). Checked and fine: "sept" (no p). A round trip over 300 lines found nothing else, homophones
aside (cent/sans, roque/roc, ma dame/madame).

"J’aurais peut-être joué {best}" lost "être" in 2 renderings of 6 ("peut-joué", the spoken "p'têt");
"Peut-être fallait-il jouer {best}" came through 8 times in 8 (ex.verdict.inaccuracy.maybe.2). Seen on
the way, left as is: "J’aurais joué tour a trois" (ex.verdict.inaccuracy.b5.2) was heard without "joué"
twice in 4.

## German

| Written | Voice said | Spoken spelling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Remis | "Remies" (with the s) | `remie` |
| en passant | "ein Passant" | `ang passang` (respell.en, respell.passant) |
| Fianchetto (and fianchettieren...) | "Fiantschetto" | `fianketto`, `fiankettieren`... |
| Pirc | "Pirk" | `pirz` |

Round trip over 800 lines. Unclear in the checks and left as they are: Rochade, rochieren, Giuoco Piano.

Word order around a move: "Ich hätte vielleicht {best} gespielt" lost a word in 4 renderings of 6 ("Ich
hätte vielleicht gespielt", "Ich hätte Turm a drei gespielt"); "Vielleicht hätte ich {best} gespielt"
came through 7 times in 8, once heard "je vier" (ex.verdict.inaccuracy.maybe.2). After "war", a pawn
move's "e" melts: "Vielleicht war e vier" was heard "Vielleicht war ich hier" 3 times in 4, so that line
keeps the move first ("{best} war vielleicht etwas genauer"). Seen on the way, left as is: "Ich hätte
Turm a drei gespielt" (ex.verdict.inaccuracy.b5.2) lost "Turm" 3 times in 4.

## Russian

- The file letter "е" alone is read "и" ("ход и пять"): squares say `йе`, as the letter sounds
  (file.e.spoken, FILE_WORDS).
- Nouns whose stress moves to the ending get it on the stem ("ко́ня", "сло́ном", "ла́дья", "хо́дов"):
  respelled with a stress mark, one respell.* entry per form (коня́, слона́, слоно́м, ладья́, ладье́, ферзя́,
  ходы́, ходо́в, фигу́р, ничья́, доско́й, выи́грывает...: see `common.lang`). A new form of these nouns
  needs its own entry. Homographs stay unmarked (ладьи, хода, ходу, доски, стоит).
- Always write ё: the voice reads "е" as written (the catalog uses ё throughout: чёрные, ещё, конём).
- "даром" is a close call between "да́ром" and "даро́м" (probe, alone and in "можно было взять даром"):
  marked `да́ром`.
- Inherent to the notation, left as is: "а пять" sounds like "опять", "е два" like "едва".
- Round trip over 1,000 lines; the stress of the 140 most frequent words and of the chess nouns compared
  with a dictionary.
- "угрозу" / "угроза" (ex.verdict.ignored) are stressed on the о, as written (probe, 3 seeds).
- "пожалуй" is a close call: alone the voice leans to пожа́луй, in "Пожалуй, я бы сыграл" to по́жалуй
  (probe, 8 seeds): marked `пожа́луй`, the dictionary stress. "возможно" (возмо́жно) and "точнее"
  (точне́е) are read as the dictionary has them (probe, 4 seeds).

## Ukrainian

- The file letter "е" alone is swallowed ("на чотири", "пішака чотири"): squares say `е́` with a
  stress mark (file.e.spoken, FILE_WORDS).
- Mobile stress on the stem, as in Russian: коня́, коне́й, слона́, слоно́ві, слоно́м, слони́, слоні́в,
  пішака́, пішаки́, пішакі́в, пішака́ми, тура́, ферзя́, ферзі́в, королю́, ходи́, хода́ми, нічию́. Round trip
  over 1,000 lines.
- "ферзем" unmarked is read like the Russian "ферзём": `ферзе́м`. Words shared with Russian are the
  ones to check first.
- Adverbs too: "задарма" is read "зада́рма" (probe, 4 seeds), the dictionary stress is `задарма́`.
- "загрозу" alone is a close call between загро́зу and загрозу́ (probe, 6 seeds); in "на мою загрозу"
  the voice says загро́зу, as the dictionary does: left unmarked (ex.hanging_threat.b3 already said it).
- "мабуть" is read мабу́ть, alone and in "Мабуть, я б зіграв так" (probe, 8 seeds); the dictionary
  stress is `ма́буть`. "можливо" (можли́во) and "трохи" (тро́хи) are read as the dictionary has them.

## Arabic

- The file letter "a" is `أيه` ("ay"): "إيه" is read "īh", hardly apart from "إي" ("e"); the
  recogniser took "بـ إيه ستة" for e6 four times in six, never with "أيه" (file.a.spoken,
  FILE_WORDS).
- Unvowelled words are read with their usual vowels (الملك as al-malik, نقلة, الوزير, شوكة); the
  catalog sets a diacritic only where a reading is ambiguous (رخّ, ملِكي). Round trip over 100 lines
  (Whisper): nothing else misread. The file letter "e" can melt into a word ending in "ī" before it
  ("في إي ثلاثة" heard "في ثلاثة" twice in six), as in Spanish.
- "أخذ" as a verbal noun ("فرصة أخذ", a chance to take) can be read as the verb "أَخَذَ": the probe
  could not tell the two apart. A line that means "a capture" uses another noun ("مكسب مجاني"), or the
  article ("الأخذ"), which no verb takes.
- The recogniser writes no short vowels, so a vowel misreading only shows in a direct comparison of
  vowelled spellings (`--probe "ar:الملك=المَلِك|المَلَك|المُلك"`); a candidate that adds only one
  diacritic is the fairest comparison, full vocalisation changes the delivery.
- "تهديدي" (my threat, ex.verdict.ignored) is read tahdīdī (probe against تُهْدِيدِي and تَهَدُّدِي).
- "ربما" (perhaps, ex.verdict.inaccuracy.maybe) is read rubbamā (probe against رُبما, رَبما and رِبما,
  4 seeds).

## Japanese

- Kana for everything the voice must not guess (file letters, numbers, counters): already the rule of
  `common.lang`. Checked over 160 lines that cover the most frequent kanji compounds; the rest read right.
- 代わり is read "たわり" in every try: `かわり`.
- 一局指し: the voice voices 指し right after 一局 ("いっきょくざし"): `一局さし`. With を ("一局を指し")
  it is fine.
- 一マス / 二マス: say `ひとマス` / `ふたマス` (count.square.spoken does).
- 狙い (the coach's threat, ex.verdict.ignored) is read ねらい, alone and in 私の狙い (probe, 3 seeds).
- を指した is read さした (probe against ざした and ゆびさした, 4 seeds).
- respell.* cannot match inside a Japanese sentence (no spaces between words): a misread word needs a
  `.spoken` line in each catalog line that uses it, and an entry in SPOKEN_WORDS for the opening texts.

## Spanish

- Checked over 300 lines: no word misread, apart from the file letter "e" after a word ending in a
  vowel, which melts into it ("la casilla e cinco", "sobre e cinco" heard without the e). "é", "ee",
  "eh" and "e-e" did no clearly better, so it stays "e". After a consonant it is heard ("en e siete"):
  prefer that in new lines.
- ex.verdict.inaccuracy.maybe puts the move after a consonant ("Quizás {best}", "por {best}"): the
  pawn move's "e" came through every time (round trip, 3 seeds).

## English

- "en passant" as written is said "in passant": `ahn pahssahn` (respell.en, respell.passant), the
  pronunciation dictionaries give. Otherwise clean over 250 lines.
- "Perhaps {best} was ..." lost the piece name in 2 renderings of 3 ("Perhaps A three"): the line starts
  with the move instead ("{best} may have been a little more precise", 8 times in 8).

## European Portuguese

| Written | Voice said | Spoken spelling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| the file letter e (squares) | swallowed after "em", "para", "era": "toma em é cinco" said "toma em cinco" | `éh` (file.e.spoken) |
| xeque-mate, xeques, xadrez | an initial x read "s" ("seque-mate", "sékes", "sadrez"); "xeque" alone right | `cheque`, `cheques`, `chadrez` (respell.*; "xeque" in "xeque-mate" is a word of its own) |
| en passant | "em passante" (with the t) | `ã passã` (respell.en, respell.passant) |
| troco (a troco de nada) | "tróco", the open o of the verb | `trôco` (respell.troco: every line has the noun) |
| Deste (you gave) starting a sentence | "dêste", the demonstrative | `Déste` (.spoken of appraisal.improve.coach_hung.b3, lesson.safety.gave) |
| Najdorf, Nimzowitsch, Winawer, Bogoljubow, Tartakower, Janowski, Horwitz | w as in English, j as in "jogo": "Najedorf", "Nimzouitch", "Uinauer" | `Naidorf`, `Nimzóvitch`, `Vináver`, `Bogoliúbov`, `Tartakóver`, `Ianóvski`, `Hórvitz` |
| Fajarowicz | "Fajaro X", "Fajarwix" | `faiaróvitch` (found in the Brazilian pass, same voice) |

- Round trip over 750 lines (Parakeet, seed 0), then 3 seeds on every word missed in more than a third of
  its uses, the reviewers' list, the file letters, the numbers and the opening names. The file letter: "é"
  came through 55 times in 111 in hard positions, "éh" 82 times; "éé" did as well as "éh" on the first 42
  but was sometimes heard as two vowels ("é a"); "á" after a vowel is heard "a" ("á", "áh", "áá" alike): left as is. The opening texts
  take file.e.spoken when tools/gen_opening_lang.py runs again.
- Checked and fine (probe, 4-8 seeds): acordo, esforço, cedo, este (closed), gambito (stress on bi),
  fianqueto, ala (the dark l makes it sound like "aula" to the recogniser), ao ([aw], not "o"), saem, sei,
  tens and the other 2nd-person -s (said; see below), Hum (said "um"), Elo, blitz, éle, á/agá said alone,
  Philidor ("Filidôr"), Evans, Fischer, Marshall, Trompowsky, Scheveningen, Sämisch ("Sémisch").
- Left as is: the verb "jogo" (eu jogo) is said with the closed o of the noun (probe, 6 seeds, two
  contexts); "jógo" gives the open o, but the recogniser then hears "joga" 11 times in 21 against 4, so the
  person could be misheard. "começo" (eu começo), "doze", "erro", "torre" are close calls between the open
  and the closed vowel, changing with the context. "Ups!" is said "óps" (probe): the same interjection.
- Recogniser habits: it writes Brazilian forms (tem for tens, pode for podes, suas for tuas, seu for teu)
  while the -s and the t are said (probe: "tens" against "tem"); "é cinco" as "S5", "roque" as "rock",
  "ala" as "aula"; it drops a line's first word when it is an interjection or a short title ("Olá!",
  "Xeque-mate!"), and it cannot write most eponyms, nor short lines that end in one (it switches to English
  or Polish).

## Brazilian Portuguese

The European Portuguese voice reads the Brazilian text (language `pt`): only misreadings are respelled, a
European vowel is left as it is. Most findings of the European Portuguese pass hold here too.

| Written | Voice said | Spoken spelling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| the file letter e (squares) | swallowed after "em", "para", "até": "toma em é cinco" said "toma em cinco" | `éh` (file.e.spoken): heard 36 times in 54 against 24 |
| até {sq} | the letter melts into "até", even as "éh": "até quatro", "até a quatro" (right 2 times in 9) | `até a casa {sq}` (.spoken of lesson.first.ask, ex.promotion.b1/b2, ex.promotion_missed.*, ex.push_passed.*): 6 in 9 |
| xeque-mate, um xeque, xeques, xadrez | an initial x read "s" ("sec mate", "sex", "sadrez"); "xeque" alone mostly right | `cheque`, `cheques`, `chadrez` (respell.*): 37 times in 78 heard with "ch", 61 respelled; xadrez 2 in 12, 11 respelled |
| en passant | "em passante", with the t (8 times in 15) | `ã passã` (respell.en, respell.passant): no t in 15 |
| troco (a troco de nada), torno (em torno de) | the open o of the verb: "a troca de nada" 6 times in 6; probe "tórno" in two contexts | `trôco` ("troco" 4 in 6), `tôrno` (respell.*: every use is the noun) |
| para, the verb (lesson.knight.l, lesson.ep.watch, an.end.unfinished, .2) | the preposition "pra" (probe, 3 contexts): "ele sempre pode", "parabéns ao lado" | `pára` (.spoken): heard "para" 9 times in 12 against 4 |
| força, the verb (an.brilliant.mate.2) | the noun "fôrça" (probe, 6 seeds) | `fórça` (.spoken) |
| Najdorf, Nimzowitsch, Winawer, Bogoljubow, Tartakower, Janowski, Horwitz, Fajarowicz | w as in English, j as in "jogo": "Nash-dorf", "Nimzo-witch", "Tarta-call", "Fajaro-wix" | `Naidorf`, `Nimzóvitch`, `Vináver`, `Bogoliúbov`, `Tartakóver`, `Ianóvski`, `Hórvitz`, `Faiaróvitch` |

- Round trip over 720 lines (Parakeet, seed 0), then 3 seeds on the words missed in more than a third of
  their uses, the reviewers' list, the file letters, the numbers, the opening names, and every fix; probes
  (4-6 seeds) for the homographs. The opening texts take `éh` from file.e.spoken ("o peão éh", no longer
  the verb); "chegar a éh quatro" is heard 5 times in 6.
- Checked and fine: rating (said "rêitin", probe), Elo, blitz, Philidor ("Filidor"), éle, á/agá said alone,
  "letra é", Uau, Opa, the numbers (quatorze, dezesseis, dezessete, dezenove, vinte e uma, cinquenta...
  written as the right digits, 3 seeds), pode (open o), sobre, the verb jogo in "jogo com calma" (open o,
  probe), Meran, Leningrado, Iugoslavo, Moscou.
- Left as is: close calls between the open and the closed vowel, changing with the context (probe): "eu
  tomo", "eu começo", "olho" (open alone and in "Fique de olho", a tie in longer contexts), erros, "cerca de" (no candidate close;
  "cerca" alone is "cêrca"). "Tente": "Tênte" did no better over 36 renderings (9 against 9).
  "onze" is read "ônze" (probe) but heard only 5 times in 12 ("ônze" 8, the same reading). Jaenisch
  ("Jaenich", j of "jogo") and Euwe ("Eu-ue"): no settled Brazilian reading to respell to.
- Recogniser habits: as in European Portuguese ("ala" as "aula", "roque" as "rock", "mate" as "match",
  short lines and interjections such as "Hum" dropped, eponyms unwritable), plus the reduced final e of
  Brazilian imperatives and subjunctives written as other forms ("Pense" as "pensa", "avance" as "avança", "Tente" as
  "sente" or "tem"), "peão" as "pião" or "pão", "doze" as "dose", "Este é" as "Eu sou".

## Danish

| Written | Voice said | Spoken spelling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| remis | with the s: "remiss" (probe), heard "ramis", "remiss", "remise" 9 times in 9 | `remi` (respell.remis): no s in 9 ("Remy", "rem i") |
| en passant | "en pasant", with the t (heard "pasant", "patient") | `passang` (respell.passant): heard "passang", "passering" 8 times in 9; "en" stays (the article: "ang passang" heard no better, 6 in 9 against 8) |
| fianchetto, fianchettoen, fianchetterer, ... | "fiantjetto" (probe), heard "fjernshadow", "fjernsjættere" | `fianketto`, `fianketterer`... (respell.*, one per form): heard "fianchetto" 2 times in 6 against 0 |
| Grand Prix | the x said: "grand priks" (probe), heard "pricks" | `pri` (respell.prix): "Grand Prix" 2 in 3 against 0 |
| epauletmat | the "au" said, heard "i Paulemat" | `epoletmat` (respell): "epolemat", "jepolet", no "au" in 6 |
| ratede | a vowel too many, heard "rejattede" 4 times in 6 | `rejtede` (respell): "rejtede" 4 in 6 |
| elleve | three syllables, as written (probe); never heard as 11 in 6 | `elve` (respell): 11 three times in 6 |
| 21, 31 ... 91; 22, 32 ... 92 | "enog", "toog" run together: 71 heard "81", "endnu halvfjerds"; 92 "2,5" | `en-og-halvfjerds` (number.X1.spoken), `to-og-halvfems` (number.X2.spoken): 71 three in 3 against 0, 32 two in 3 against 0, 92 five in 6 against 2; 52 the same either way, 86 worse with hyphens, so other units stay joined |

- Parakeet could not do Danish: its language detection wrote English or German (or nothing) for 592 of the 750
  lines of the first round trip. Redone with Whisper medium set to `da`: 219 lines covering 1,120 words (seed
  0; the second chunk stopped at the time limit), then 3 seeds on 103 lines (the reviewers' list, file
  letters, numbers, eponyms, every fix), and probes. Even then 35% of the words come back wrong: the voice's
  Danish is soft and the recogniser guesses.
- Checked and fine: rating (heard "rating" 5 in 6, once "raiding"; `rejting` heard worse), Elo, `æl` for the L
  (heard "el" 3 in 3), `ét` (long e, probe), `Én` starting a sentence, be, se (B5, C3 every time in a
  sentence), hå (H3, H5 mostly), dé (heard "de", the letter's name), Wow, Ups, Hmm (said, probe), 13, 17, 19,
  86, 103, "ét komma fem", the v and d of halvtreds, halvfjerds, halvfems silent (probe), sort ("sårt"),
  Philidors ("Filidors"), Caro-Kann, Tarrasch ("tarrasj"), Nimzowitsch ("nimzovitsj"), Sämisch, Schliemann
  ("sjliman"), Morphy, Fischer, Ponziani, Horwitz, Winawer, Trompowsky, Stonewall (heard right), Bongcloud,
  Halloween, Breyer, Colle, Torre, Grünfeld ("grynfeld"), Aljechins, Fajarowicz, Marshall.
- Left as is: the file letter é is heard "E" about half the time, "i" otherwise; `ee` and `eh` did no better
  (`eh` heard as "F"). The letter a is heard as A once in about 20 ("at", "af", "R", or lost): `ah` and `á`
  did no better; the recogniser takes Danish A and R for each other. "ge to" was heard "K2" 3 times in 3 ("ge
  tre" is G3). "Fair nok": `Fær nok` heard worse (0 in 6 against 1). Miles is read "mi-les" (probe), but
  `Majls` was heard the same. "remisen", "remisagtige", "remisvåben" keep the s (`remien` heard worse). Close
  calls, left: Giuoco ("gjuoko"), Owens, Evans, Birds, Parham (read the Danish way), Zukertort ("sukertort"),
  Scheveningen ("sh"), Av; the 't of Van 't Kruijs is swallowed.
- Recogniser habits: hvid as "ved" (the voice says "vid": probe), bonden as "bånden", mat as "mad", ad as
  "af", felter as "fælder", én and ét written "en", "et"; it drops "Hmm"; it often writes the numbers from 50
  up as pieces ("enoghalvfjerds" heard "en halv fjerts") though the v and d are silent as they should be (probe).

## Korean

| Written | Voice said | Spoken spelling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 퀸과 (the queen and/with) | "큉과": the final ㄴ turns into ㅇ before the ㄱ, and the recogniser hears 킹과 (the king) 10 times in 16 (퀸 4 times) | `퀸하고` (respell.퀸과, the same "and/with"): 퀸 15 times in 24, 킹 once |
| 퀸까지 (as far as the queen) | "큉까지": 킹까지 8 times in 13 (퀸 3 times) | `퀸에까지` (respell.퀸까지): 퀸 9 times in 15, never 킹 |
| 퀸 근처 (ex.fork.tip.knight) | the same across the space: 킹 근처 3 times in 3 | `퀸의 근처` (.spoken): 퀸 2 times in 3 |

- Round trip over 300 lines (Whisper medium, seed 0), then 3 seeds on about 110 lines: the reviewers'
  list, the file letters, the numbers, the opening names and eponyms and the words missed most, and
  `tools/tts_pronunciation.py --probe` (4-5 seeds) on the doubtful ones. The voice turns a final ㄴ into
  ㅇ before ㄱ ㄲ ㅋ, which standard Korean does not do (퀸과 is [퀸과]). A space does not stop it ("퀸 과",
  "퀸 까지": 킹 7 times in 15). Only 퀸 becomes another piece. "폰과" is said "퐁과" (heard 펑과, 폼과) and
  레닌그라드 is said 레닝그라드: both left as they are. In a new line, avoid 퀸 right before ㄱ ㄲ ㅋ ("이른
  퀸 공격" came through 3 times in 3, "퀸 근처" never).
- Checked and fine: 흑은 [흐근], 백은 [배근], 백의 [배게], 갬빗 (= 겜빗), 피앙케토 (= 피앙캐토, not
  피앙차토), 이른 (not 이런), 수째 (tense, not 수제), 십구 [십꾸], 견고한, 기보지 (not 기본지), 중앙,
  체스, 동형 (with the ㅎ weakened, as Korean speakers say it), 엘로 3 times in 3, 정돈합니다, 오 플러스 삼 3 times in 3,
  칠십오 수 and 오십 수 6 times in 6, 백 점 (heard 100점), 예순네 칸, 최선수, 더블 체크, 칠 랭크, 위나워 (not
  위나와), 나이도르프 (not 나이돌프), 보트비닉 3 times in 3. Also the file letters (에이 비 씨 디 이 에프 지 에이치: after
  a pause 디 is [ti], as with other Korean lax stops) and the hyphen of 블랙마-디머 and 님조-라르센 (a short pause). 엘자 is said
  [엘짜] (probe); written `엘짜` it came through 2 times in 3, against 1 time in 3, too few to change it.
- Left as is: 스테일메이트 is heard 스틸, 스테이 or 스텔 메이트 (right 1 time in 17). The probe puts it near
  스테이메이트 (a weak l, as in 마일스, heard 마이스), and "스테일 메이트" with a space did no better (0 in 9).
  폰 is heard 푼, 톤 or 펀 about two times in five, but the probe has 폰을 = 포늘, far from 푼을 and 펀을.
  두셨어요 was heard 드셨어요 ("you ate") or 주셨어요 5 times in 5. The probe cannot tell ㅜ from ㅡ there (nor in
  주셨어요), and there is no other spelling. 브레이어 at the start of a sentence was heard with a ㄱ (그래요,
  그레이어) 4 times in 4. The probe cannot tell it from 그레이어. 칠십오 is said [칠시보], not [칠씨보]. "나이트 에프
  칠" was heard "나이트의 부츠" 2 times in 3: the f melts into the vowel before it, as e does in Spanish.
- Recogniser habits: it writes 예요 as 에요 (and 무승부예요 as 무승부해요), 백의 as 배개 or 되게, 흑은 as
  혹은 or 흙은, and 기물을 as 기무를 (its sound). It also writes 씨 as 시, 갬빗 as 겐빗, 무승부 as 무슨 부, and 스큐어 as
  스퀘어 (`스큐우어` gave 스퀴어). It writes squares and numbers as notation ("e4", "100점"). The first word of a line is
  often lost or replaced (흑은 and 백은 are heard 이건, 하겐, 되게). It cannot write most eponyms (님조비치 as 닌조비치, 그륀펠트 as
  그린펠트). It turns short lines of names into English or into a caption ("Smart AdMate", "(끝)"). It cuts lines of
  more than about 50 syllables short.

## Italian

| Written | Voice said | Spoken spelling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fianchetto, fianchetti | the c of "cena": heard "fiancetto" 11 times in 21, right 7 | `fianketto`, `fianketti` (respell.*): right 16 in 21, never "fiancetto" |
| en passant | Italian, with the t: heard "in passante", a t 19 times in 21 | `an passàn` (respell.en, respell.passant): a t 6 times in 21 |
| lettone (gambetto lettone) | stressed on the first syllable, "lèttone" (probe): heard "letto" 7 times in 9 | `lettóne` (respell): right 8 in 9 |
| settima (the seventh rank) | the stress leaves the first syllable: heard "settimana" 6 times in 9 | `sèttima` (respell): right 9 in 9 |
| Pirc | "pirch" (probe; heard "Pirce", "Peach") | `Pirts` (respell): heard "Piers", "Piez" |
| Grand Prix | the d and the x said ("Grand Priks", probe; heard "freaks", "breaks", the line taken for English 3 times in 3) | `Gran Prì` (respell): no x in 6, the line heard in Italian 2 in 3 |
| clou | "clo-u" (probe; heard "Clau" 3 times in 3) | `clu` (respell): heard "clou", "clú" |
| dalla a all’acca (lesson.welcome.files) | the letter a melts into "dalla": "dalla lacca" 6 times in 6 | `dalla a, fino all’acca` (.spoken): a heard 2 in 3 |

- Round trip over 750 lines (Parakeet, seed 0; 19% of words missed), then 3 seeds on 205 short segments
  covering every word missed in more than a third of its uses (splits, joins and garbled transcripts set
  aside), the reviewers' list, the file letters, the numbers and the opening names in carrier sentences
  ("Hai aperto con la difesa ..."); probes (3-6 seeds) for the names, the homographs and the stress.
- Checked and fine: the numbers (29 test lines in 30 written as the right digits: undici to novanta,
  ventitré, quarantotto, per cento), Philidor ("Filidor"), Elo, blitz, rapid ("ràpid"), robot ("ròbot"),
  acconcio, di’ ("dì"), ancora (ancóra), capitano (the verb), Mmm (hummed, not spelled), Ops, Ahi, Caspita,
  elle, patta, alfiere, sull’ala, gambetto (probe: none read as the recogniser wrote them), the stress of
  the frequent proparoxytones (muovere, prendere, ultima, pratica, debole...), Najdorf ("Naidorf"), Réti,
  Morphy, Fischer, Sämisch, Tarrasch, Marshall, Sveshnikov (sh), Max Lange (hard g), Chigorin (heard
  "Cigorin" as written: `Cigorin` heard no better), Maróczy, Kieseritzky, Steinitz, Rubinstein, Tartakower,
  Schlechter, Zaitsev, Rossolimo, Halloween.
- Left as is: the king "re" is heard badly (0 in 18 with Parakeet, 3 in 15 with Whisper in six lines): it
  runs into the word before ("tuo re" heard "tuore", "tour"), but it is said (probe), and "Re", "rre",
  "rè" did no better. The file letters e and a melt into a vowel before them ("da e quattro" heard "dai
  quattro", "la casa a sei" "la casa 6"); "é", "eh", "à", "ah" did no better (e 9 times in 27 in such
  lines, "é" 6, "eh" 9): as in Spanish, prefer a consonant before a square in new lines ("in e quattro").
  "subito" is "sùbito" alone, a close call in "devi uscirne subito" (probe). Alekhine keeps its final e
  ("Alekìne", stress right; without the e the stress moved to the first syllable). Close calls or no
  settled Italian reading: Scheveningen (sh), Schliemann, Nimzowitsch (about "Nimzovic"), McCutcheon, Euwe
  ("E-u-e"), Jaenisch, Jobava, Winawer, Bogoljubow, Breyer, Stonewall, Fajarowicz; Miles is "mi-les", but
  `Mails` was heard no better.
- Recogniser habits: it writes the verb forms its language model prefers ("guadagno di materiale" as
  "guadagna", "catturo" as "cattur"; probe: the o is said), merges vowels across words ("Bianco ottiene"
  as "Bianco tiene", "Stavolta arrocca" as "rocca", "di re" as "dire"), splits compounds ("campo chiaro",
  "in chioda", "per mettere"), hears "patta" as "fatta", "acca otto" as "K8", "alfiere" as "alpiere", and
  takes short lines, or a line that starts with an interjection or a foreign name, for another language
  ("Gran bel salto!", "Ahi, ..." came out Finnish, Dutch or English).

## Hindi

| Written | Voice said | Spoken spelling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ग़लती, ग़लतियाँ, ग़लतियों, ग़लत | the nukta ग़ as a weak fricative that melts after a vowel or a nasal: "गंभीर ग़लती" heard "गम भी रलालती", "गम ही रहती" (the g heard 9 times in 18, in five contexts) | `गलती`, `गलतियाँ`, `गलतियों`, `गलत` (respell.*), as most Hindi speakers say them: the g heard 17 times in 18, "गंभीर गलती" 3 times in 3 against 0 |

- The main round trip (300 lines, Whisper medium) is unusable as it stands: sherpa-onnx's Whisper allows about 6 tokens
  per second of audio, and Hindi takes several byte tokens per word, so every transcript stops after a few words.
  The audio padded with silence to 30 s lifts the limit (Whisper pads to 30 s anyway). Redone that way: 114 short lines,
  3 seeds (file letters, squares, numbers 11-99, ordinals, decimals, the reviewers' list, the opening names and
  eponyms, the words missed most), 25 lines of A/B variants, then probes (4 seeds). Spelling differences (nukta,
  ँ/ं, ॉ, vowel length, ह dropped) were counted as heard right.
- Checked and fine: the number words (29 to 99, 21-58, the -हत्तर family: पचहत्तर is said "pach-hattar", probe),
  the ordinals, "दशमलव", "माइनस", "प्लस", the letters (एल, ई, जी, सी, ए, एच as "ech"), खड़ी/घोड़ा (ड़ said), schwa
  deletion (हमला heard "हम्ला", ब्लिट्ज़ and पास्ड end without a vowel, probe), पिर्क (one syllable, the k said),
  पानोव and बोगोल्युबोव (the v said), नाइडोर्फ़, निम्ज़ोविच, पोंज़ियानी, ब्लैकमार-डीमर, कापाब्लांका, फ़ायारोविच,
  कंगारू, इतालवी, ट्रांसपोज़िशन, हाइपरमॉडर्न, सी-फ़ाइल. मोहरा is said "muhra", a common pronunciation.
- Left as is: ऊँट, ऊंट and उँट are heard alike ("उंट", "ओट", "आउट", right about half the time); ओपनिंग is heard
  "अपनिंग"/"आपनिंग" nearly every time, but once written "opening" in an English transcript, and "अोपनिंग" did no
  better (nor "अोर" for ओर, heard "और"); the probe cannot tell ओ from औ or ऊ. एफ़ is heard "एप" in "घोड़ा एफ़ सात"
  but "F3" in "चाल थी: घोड़ा एफ़ तीन": "ऐफ़" and "एफ़्फ़" did no better; "ऐच" no better than एच. "ए छह" is heard
  "इच्छा" whatever the spelling of the six (छह, छः, छे). ख़ूब (heard "कूप") and बग़ल were heard no better without the
  nukta. उफ़ at the start of a line is dropped (उफ़्फ़ heard once in 3). The v of -व्स्की (यानोव्स्की,
  ट्रॉम्पोव्स्की) is weak, as in the Polish -wski. "एल आज़माओ" runs together ("है लाजमाओ"), a liaison.
- Recogniser habits: it writes the frequent word for a letter or a number (बी as "भी", डी as "दी", सात as "साथ",
  पहली as "पहले", उनसठ as "उनसे"), the retroflex ट/ड often as dental, ई as इ, final stops with the wrong voicing
  ("तुरंद", "सफेथ", "मजबूट"), squares as notation ("F3", "D5"); it drops or garbles a line's first word and short
  lines of English words (मिडिलगेम, स्टेलमेट, स्क्यूअर), cannot write most eponyms, and loops ("आपका आपका ...") on
  some lines.

## Bulgarian

| Written | Voice said | Spoken spelling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| the file letter a (squares) | melts into the word before it: "на а три" heard "на три" (4 times in 12 heard as A) | `а́` (file.a.spoken): heard A 8 times in 12, and twice more as "ная" |
| дъската | "дъ́ската" (probe, 3 contexts), heard "диската" 7 times in 9 | `дъска́та` (respell): heard "диската" 3 times in 9 |
| ан пасан | "па́сан" (probe, alone and in "се нарича ан пасан") | `паса́н` (respell.пасан) |
| пропусна, Изпусна, отдръпна (aorist, "you missed") | the present: "пропу́сна", "изпу́сна", "отдръ́пна" (probe, alone and in "Тук пропусна шанс", "Пропусна мат", "Изпусна от поглед") | `пропусна́` (respell); `Изпусна́`, `отдръпна́` (.spoken of ex.verdict.ignored.b1.3, praise.saved.b1.2) |
| Върна (aorist, appraisal.num.takebacks.*) | the present: "Въ́рна един ход" (probe) | `Върна́` (.spoken) |
| права линия (lesson.rook.intro) | "права́" (feminine of "прав", right) instead of "пра́ва" (straight) | `пра́ва` (.spoken) |
| царя | "царя́" in "Пази царя си", "шах на царя" (probe); царят, конят, коня are right | `ца́ря` (respell) |
| полета | "поле́та" (probe, alone, "две полета направо", "шестдесет и четири полета") | `полета́` (respell) |
| единадесет ... деветнадесет | stressed "-наде́сет" (probe, every teen); heard "едно на десет" | `едина́десет` ... `деветна́десет` (respell.*): heard as 16 to 19 8 times in 24 (3 of them as whole numbers), never with the plain spelling |
| Мароци | "Маро́ци" (probe) | `ма́роци` (respell) |

- Bulgarian writes no stress, and the voice guesses it: the stress of the 120 most frequent words (and of the
  reviewers' homographs) was compared over every vowel with U+0301, which the voice follows (вода́ against
  во́да), then in a phrase where a word came out wrong alone. Parakeet could not do Bulgarian (English or
  nothing for most lines); the round trip is Whisper medium set to `bg`: 300 lines (seed 0), then 3 seeds on
  about 50 lines (fixes against the plain text, the file letters, the numbers) and 1 seed on 84 more (the
  reviewers' list, 27 opening names, 30 eponyms in carrier sentences).
- Checked and fine (probe): реми (реми́), Филидор in "защитата на Филидор" (Филидо́р), Следи, води, търси, удари
  (both stresses as close), подред, отказа (отка́за, the aorist as the dictionary has it), затова, срещу,
  добър, център, ендшпил, дебют, гамбит, вилица, позиция, атака, черните, царят, конят, коня, губиш, опитай,
  груба, седем, осем, Бенони, Оуен. Heard right (round trip): реми, Опа, Леле, Ох, Хм (mostly), луфт,
  кандидат-ходове, буквата гъ ("га"), от а до аш, the eponyms and opening names that Whisper can write.
- Left as is: the file letter е after "ни" or "е" melts into the vowel ("Трябва ни е четири" heard "ни 4");
  `е́` fixes that (3 in 3) but after "на", the commonest context, it is heard "я" (4 in 6 against 0), so it stays
  "е". "ще върна" (present, ex.rewind) is a close call (probe), and `въ́рна` was heard "върнеш", "върнем": left.
  еф after a vowel is heard "в" ("напада еф седем" as "нападе в седем"); `е́ф` did no better. фианкето is
  said "фиа́нкето" (probe), but `фианке́то` was heard worse ("ФНК ето", "хиянкия": 1 good in 6 against 4).
  двадесет leans to "двадесе́т" alone, a tie in "ход двадесет"; четири leans to "четири́" alone, a tie in "на е
  четири"; рапид is "ра́пид" (the English word's stress); Коле is "Ко́ле", Торе a reduced "Тора", Ело a tie.
  The opening texts take `а́` when tools/gen_opening_lang.py runs again (squares come from file.*.spoken).
- Whisper hears a final stressed а as "ая" or "ай" (`пропусна́` as "пропусная" 2 times in 3, `Върна́` once as
  "Върнай"), though the probe puts `пропусна́` as close to "пропусна" as to "пропусная": kept for the grammar.
- Recogniser habits: it writes squares as notation (б5, ц3, D4, Ж8, "аж 8" for аш осем), teens as "N на 10",
  "единайсет"-style colloquial numbers only, unstressed ъ as "а" or "е" (дъската as "даската"), and Russian
  spellings (сицилиянската, классически, "черни те"); it writes eponyms in English or Latin letters ("Gambit
  England", "Robinshine", "Morphy") and drops the a of a name after "защита" ("защита Лехини").

## Swedish

| Written | Voice said | Spoken spelling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| en passant | with the t: heard "en patient", "en procent", "passent" 6 times in 9 | `passang` (respell.passant): no t in 9, "en passang" 3 in 3; "en" stays (the article) |
| 27, 37 ... 97 (tjugosju, fyrtiosju ...) | the s of "sju" goes to the tens: "fyrtios ju" (probe), heard "trettioås u", "sextiosju" as 60-80; the right number 0 times in 12 | `fyrtio sju`... (number.X7.spoken, with a space): right 4 in 12, the sj said in most of the rest ("sker", "skik"); a hyphen did no better (0 in 6) |
| Birds (Birds öppning) | the Swedish i, "Birrds" (probe), heard "bygds", "bereds" | `Börds` (respell.birds): heard "börs" 2 in 3 |
| Miles (Tony Miles) | two syllables, "Mi les" (probe), heard "Bailas", "Meiles" | `Majls` (respell.miles): heard "Miles" 3 in 3, against 1 |
| Stonewall, Stonewallangreppet, Stonewallvarianten | three Swedish syllables, "Stonevall" (probe), heard "stående av alla" 3 in 3 | `Stounwåll`... (respell.*, one per compound): two syllables, heard "stanboll", "stanvård" |
| Grand Prix | the x said, "Grand Priks" (probe, far from "Grand Pri"), heard "pricks" 2 in 6 | `Pri` (respell.prix): no x in 3 |

- The main round trip (300 lines, Whisper medium set to `sv`, seed 0; Parakeet missed 70 % of the words) ran
  before the 30 s padding, so long lines were cut. Then 3 seeds on 110 short lines (the reviewers' list, the
  file letters, the numbers, the opening names and eponyms in "Öppningen är X, inte Y.", the words missed
  most), 49 lines of A/B variants, and probes (4 seeds) on the doubtful readings.
- Checked and fine: the file letters (a, be, se, dé, é, eff, ghé, hå, heard as the letters or as notation),
  `ell` (heard L 6 times in 6), Elo (probe: `Élo`, the long e; "yellow" is the recogniser), rating, Hmm (hummed),
  Aj, Varsågod, dammatt, kvävningsmatt, epålettmatt, femtio- and sjuttiofemdragsregeln, blundrar, the numbers elva,
  tolv, tretton, fjorton, sjutton, nitton, 21, 34, 64, 85 procent, 92, "plus ett komma fem", patt (probe: `pat`), Tarrasch (`Tarrasj`), Diemer
  (`Dimer`), Bongcloud (`Bångklaud`), Caro-Kann, Philidor, Petrov, Zukertort, Aljechin, Nimzowitsch, Owen,
  Horwitz, Ponziani, Torre, Colle, Bogo, Tjigorin, Nimzo-Larsen, Grob, Mieses, Van Geet, Jobava, From,
  Karlsbad, Alapin, Smith-Morra, Rossolimo, Svesjnikov, Tajmanov, Winawer, Rubinstein, Panov, Giuoco piano,
  Evans, Fegatello, Traxler, Morphy, Marshall, Parham, Halloween, Sämisch, Falkbeer, Maróczy, Känguru, Semi-Tarrasch,
  Englund, Saragossa, Leningrad, Botvinnik, Karpov, Breyer, Zajtsev, Sozin, fianchetterar, remiaktig.
- Left as is: "torn", "tornet", "tornen" are heard "tårn", "tån", "tånet" most of the time, and the probe puts
  "torn" nearest "tårn"; `toorn` and `tuorn` were heard the same (the recogniser may also be writing
  Norwegian). Pirc is read "Pirk" (probe); `Pirts` was heard "pitch", "pets", no better. Schliemann is read
  "Sliman" and `Sjlimann` was heard the same. Fajarowicz ("Fire Witch") and `Fajarovitj`: the same. Pterodaktyl
  (the "pte" garbled), Scheveningen, Richter ("Rikter"), Réti and Najdorf are heard badly, with no
  candidate. "remi" before "enligt" is heard "rea med", "VME" (probe: `rémi`, no clear candidate). "arton"
  and "sjuttioett" read well alone (probe), but after "tog" they were never heard right. "dam" is
  sometimes heard "damm" or "dom" (probe: dam, damm and daam alike).
- Recogniser habits: squares and numbers as notation; compounds joined or split ("i stället" written
  "istället", "kungs flygel"); v heard as b ("Bits tid", "bitslöppare"); the sj sound written "sk", "ch" or
  "tj"; the first word of a short line lost; eponyms garbled. Whisper writes the spelling it knows ("Grand
  Prix", "Miles") whatever the voice says.

## Polish

| Written | Voice said | Spoken spelling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| the file letter a (squares) | runs into the word before it: "na a sześć" heard "na sześć", "ruch a trzy" heard "rucha trzy" (the probe puts "na a sześć" near "na sześć") | `aa` (file.a.spoken): heard as the a-file 22 times in 30, against 12 for "a", over 10 contexts |
| sto (appraisal.num.acc_explain.b3, .b3.2) | said, but heard as "co", "to" or "z" 8 times in 8 | `sto procent` (.spoken): 6 times in 6 |
| fianchetto, fianchetta, fianchettem, fianchettami | "fiancetto" (probe), heard "Jan Szeto", "Piętrze to" | `fianketto`... (respell.*): heard with a k ("fialkietem", "ankietem") |
| Giuoco | "gi-uoko" (probe: Dżuoko far), heard "Duoco", "Głoco" | `dżuoko`: heard "Dżłoko" 2 times in 3 |
| Grand Prix | the d and the x said ("Grand Priks", probe), heard "pliks", "freaks" | `gran pri` (respell.grand, respell.prix): no x in 3 |

| Steinitz(a), Rubinstein(a), Spielmann(a), Schliemann(a) | as written: "Stejnica", "Rubinstejna", "Spilmana", "Szlemana" (probe) | `sztajnic(a)`, `rubinsztajn(a)`, `szpilman(a)`, `szliman(a)`: heard "Sztajnica", "Spielmana" 3 in 3 (against "Spearman", "spiralny"), "ślimana" |
| Sämisch(a), Jaenisch(a), Grünfeld(a), Miesesa | "Samisza", "Ja-e-nisza", "Grunfelda", "Mjesesa" (probe) | `zemisz(a)`, `jenisz(a)`, `grynfeld(a)`, `mizesa`: "Zemisza" 3 in 3 (against "Samisha"), "Grimfelda", "mi zesa" |
| Kieseritzky | "Kjeseritzki" (probe) | `kizericki` ("Kizericki'ego"): heard "Kizerickiego", "Kizeryckiego" |
| Maróczy | the Polish ó: "Maruczy" (probe, heard "maruczego" 2 in 3) | `maroczy`: "maroczego" 3 in 3 |
| Réti, Rétiego | é as "ej" or "y": "Rejtiego" (probe), heard "Rytiego", "rytmiego" | `reti`, `retiego`: heard "retiego", "trzeciego" |
| Owena, Milesa, McCutcheon(a), Kruijsa, Geeta, Jobavy | read as Polish: "Owena" (w = v), "Milesa", "Mkuczona", "Krui-sa", "Gieta", "Jobawy" (probe) | `ołena`, `majlsa`, `makaczon(a)`, `krajsa`, `chejta`, `dżobawy`: "Majsa", "makaczona" 2 in 3 (against none), "drzabawy" (against "obawy" 3 in 3) |

- Parakeet missed most words; the round trips are Whisper medium set to `pl`: 300 lines (seed 0, 18% of words
  missed), then 3 seeds on 109 lines (the reviewers' list, 100 opening names and eponyms in short carrier
  lines, the file letters, the L, numbers 11 to 100, decimals, the words missed most), on 32 lines of fixes,
  and on 32 lines of A/B variants of the file letters; probes (4 seeds) for every name and doubtful word.
- Checked and fine: goniec, gońca, gońcem (probe: "koniec", "końca" far; the recogniser often writes a k),
  hetman (the h said; heard "headman", "hitman"), the numbers (jedenaście to dziewięćdziesiąt dziewięć,
  sześćdziesiąt cztery, dwudziesty pierwszy, "plus dwa przecinek trzy" as the right digits, 3 seeds), el for the
  L, Hmm, Elo, blitz ("blic"), „poprawiam”, w przelocie ("pszelocie"), umknęło, zagram, epoletowy, jeż ("jesz"),
  Caro-Kann, Philidora (= "Filidora"), Horwitza, Collego, Tarrascha, Scheveningen (= "Szeweningen"), Marshalla,
  Morphy'ego, Halloween, Breyera, Evansa, Fischera, Schlechtera, Capablanki, Greco, Maxa Langego, Najdorfa,
  Richtera-Rauzera, Czigorina, Torrego, Bongcloud (= "Bongklaud"), Smitha (= "Smita"), Blackmara (= "Blekmara"),
  Falkbeera (= "Falkbera"), Stauntona ("Stałntona", near the English), the Russian and Polish names.
- Left as is: the file letter e melts the same way ("na e cztery" near "na cztery", a line-initial "e bije"
  lost), but `ee` did no clearly better (17 times in 33 against 14; heard "i" or "A"; `eh` is said "ech"). The
  opening texts keep "a" until tools/gen_opening_lang.py runs again (their squares come from file.*.spoken).
  Close calls in the probe, the recogniser hearing another word: czarne ("czarny"), bierki ("bielki"), roszadę
  ("ruszadę", "rozsada"). No settled Polish reading, left: Stonewall (no candidate close), Euwe ("Ełwe"),
  Nimzowitscha and nimzoindyjska (said with z, as many Polish players do), Diemera ("Djemera": `Dimera` heard the
  same), Van't.
- Recogniser habits: it writes "piąka" for pionka (the same sound: [pʲɔŋka]), splits "skoczka" as "z koczka",
  writes gońca as "końca", final -ę as -e and -e as -y ("czarny", "matę"), roszada as "rozsada", squares as
  notation (A6, E4), and garbles short lines and lines of names.

## Turkish

| Written | Voice said | Spoken spelling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Caro-Kann | the Turkish c ("dj"): heard "Jarokan", "Çarokan" 3 times in 3 (probe: nearest "Çaro-Kan") | `Karo-Kan` (respell.caro, respell.kann): "karokan" 3 in 3, and in opening.say.transposed |
| Pirc | the Turkish c: heard "peş", "pirse" (probe: nearest "Pirç") | `Pirts` (respell): "Pirç", "pırtis", "pırt" in opening lines, no "dj" |

| Mieses | "Miyeses" (probe), heard "mss" twice, "mesele" | `Mizes` (respell): "Mises", "mizas" |
| Tarrasch (also Yarı Tarrasch) | "Tarrasç" (probe), heard "tarif", "tarah" | `Tarraş` (respell): "taraş", "taraj" 3 in 3 |
| Grand Prix | the x said (probe: nearest "Priks"), heard "predicts" once in 3 | `Pri` (respell.prix): "Grand Prix" 3 in 3 |
| Maróczy | no candidate close (probe), heard "Maroti", "Maroxi", "Marauder" | `Maroçi` (respell): "Maroç", "Marocca", and "maroç" in accelerated_dragon.advanced |
| Fajarowicz | heard "fajarobik", "frontrager" | `Fayaroviç` (respell): "Fyarovich", "Fayyarovic", "Fajarović" 3 in 3 in budapest.advanced |
| Colle | two syllables: "koalya", "kola", "koal et" | `Kol` (respell): one syllable, "kual" 2 in 3 |
| L ("Başka bir L dene", lesson.knight.wrong) | "le" melts after "bir": "birader ne", "bir nedeni", "bile deme" (probe: nearest "bir ne") | `lee` (.spoken): "leydene", "Leyden'i" 2 in 3 |

- The voice reads every word with Turkish letter values, foreign names too (c "dj", j "zh", ch "ç", ie two
  vowels, w as v). A new eponym needs checking for these letters first.
- The main round trip (300 lines, Whisper medium set to `tr`, seed 0) covered few opening names. Then 3 seeds on
  99 lines (file letters, numbers, ordinals, decimals, the reviewers' list, 60 opening names and eponyms in "Bu X,
  Y değil.", the words missed most), 43 lines of A/B variants in "Bugün X çalışacağız.", 7 real lines with the
  fixes, and probes (4 seeds).
- Checked and fine: the numbers (11 to 98, "yüzde yetmiş bir", "artı bir virgül beş", "eksi iki virgül sıfır",
  the ordinals: heard right 3 in 3, mostly as digits), the file letters a, ce, de, e, he (heard as the letter or as
  notation), "Le şeklinde" (2 in 3), Elo, Of, Vay, Hımm (hummed or dropped), Philidor (probe: read "Filidor"; "pide
  dör" is the recogniser), berabere (probe: the final e said; Whisper writes "beraber"), mattı, buluştu, gambiti
  (probe: as written; Whisper writes "gamete"), fil (probe: not "film"), vezir (probe: not "bezir"/"mezir"), piyonu
  (probe: no candidate better; Whisper writes "piyano", "pion"), kâğıdına, imkânsızsa, Kalem, Owen ("Oven"), Horwitz,
  Réti, Ponziani, Trompowsky, Elephant, Saragossa, Stonewall, Bongcloud, Scheveningen, Rubinstein,
  Evans, Traxler, Morphy, Marshall, Schliemann, Stafford, Parham, Halloween, Sämisch, Falkbeer, Zukertort,
  Sveşnikov, Taymanov, Alapin, Benoni, Benko, Pterodaktil, Nimzo-Hint, Bogo-Hint, Nimzo-Larsen, Grob, Çigorin,
  Petrov, Englund, Borg, Torre, Panov, Sicilya, Slav, Rauzer, Botvinnik, Karpov, Miles, Breyer.
- Left as is: hâlâ and hâlde are read like hala and halde, short vowels and a hard l (probe; "haalaa" is farther,
  and the recogniser cannot tell them apart), as many speakers say them. Bird is read with the Turkish i (probe:
  `Börd` differs) but neither was heard right ("bir de", "bir arada"). Jobava is read with the Turkish j;
  `Cobava` was heard worse ("Cobaba" once, "kopağ"). Aziz George was heard "George" 3 in 3 though the probe finds no
  close candidate; `Corc` was heard "Kord", "Korkut". Winawer and `Vinaver` were heard alike badly ("WinAware",
  "binavar"; probe: close). Carlsbad leans to "Çarlsbad" (probe) but plain and `Karlsbad` were heard the same
  ("CarSpot"). The file letter a after a vowel melts into it ("kale a üç" heard "kala üç"), and fe and be run into
  their rank ("bebeş", "otwcb"), as with any letter before a number. Unclear, no candidate tried: Smith-Morra
  ("Smithmore'a" once in 3), Van Geet ("van-git", "OneGate"), Rossolimo ("Rosoliman").
- Recogniser habits: squares and numbers as notation; v heard as b or m ("Bezir", "mezir", "ve zirve"); "hamlesi"
  heard "hamilesi"; "hâlâ" written "hala"; a word's final vowel swallowed into a frequent word (berabere as
  "beraber", piyonu as "piyano"); eponyms in English spellings; short lines garbled.
- The opening texts said "dört'e" in the round trip's renderings (an older openings file); the repository's
  `assets/coach/openings/tr.lang` already says "dörde", "beşe" (tools/gen_opening_lang.py, TR_SQUARE_SUFFIX_RE).

## Estonian

| Written | Voice said | Spoken spelling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Grand Prix' (rünnak) | the x said: "Priks" (probe: Priks +0.47, Prii +9.18) | `prii` (respell.prix): read "Prii" (probe), no x in 3 renderings of the game line ("prii", "prüü") |
| Giuoco (piano, pianissimo) | the g of "gaas", as written: heard "kiuoko" 3 times in 6 (probe: Džuoko +2.23, the farthest) | `džuoko` (respell): heard "juoko", "jooko", "Joko" 6 times in 6 |
| Milesi (variant) | "Mi-lesi", as written: heard "millesi" 3 times in 3 | `mailsi` (respell): heard "mailsi", "mäilsi" 3 in 3, "mails" 2 in 3 in the game line |
| Birdi (avang) | "Birdi", as written: heard "pirdi", "püüdi" (probe: neither Bördi nor Beerdi close) | `bördi` (respell): heard "pöördi" 2 times in 3 |
| Breyer, Breyeri | "Brejeri": heard "prejeri" 2 times in 3 (probe: Brejeri -0.36, Braieri +1.13) | `braier`, `braieri` (respell): heard "brajeri", "prajeri" 4 times in 6 |
| Parhami (rünnak) | the h said: heard "parhami", "parhaami" 2 times in 3 | `paarami` (respell): heard "paarami" 2 in 3, "paarame" in the game line |
| Sämisch, Sämischi | the sch as "s" (probe: Sämissi +0.07, Sämiši +0.39): heard "semisi", "missi", once "samishi" | `sämiš`, `sämiši` (respell): "sh" heard 4 times in 6 against 1 in 3 |
| Nimzo-, Nimzowitsch, Nimzowitschi | the z as "s" (probe: Nimsovitši closest): heard "nimsu", "nimse vitsi", never a ts in 9 | `nimtso`, `nimtsovitš`, `nimtsovitši` (respell): "ts" heard 4 times in 9 ("nimtsu", "nimtsavits") |

- Parakeet could not do Estonian; the main round trip is Whisper medium set to `et`, 300 lines (seed 0, the first 195
  before the 30 s padding), with half the words missed: the voice's Estonian is understandable, the recogniser's
  Estonian weak. Then 3 seeds on 48 lines (the reviewers' coach words, the file letters in carriers, the numbers),
  30 lines naming 60 openings and eponyms ("See on X, mitte Y.") with 15 respelled variants, 51 lines of game text
  (the fixes and the most missed words), and probes (4 seeds) on 50 readings.
- Checked and fine: the file letters aa, bee, tsee, dee, eff, gee, haa (heard as letters or notation); `ee` alone
  is said long (probe: "täht ee" nearest "täht eee", far from "täht"); `ell` (heard "el" 6 in 6); Hmm (hummed, probe,
  heard "Hmm" 6 in 6), Vau, Oi-oi, Hei, Tuli!, Elo (heard "elo"), Ekspert, kandidaatkäike, forsseeritud, parandan, kella;
  the numbers (üksteist ... üheksateist, 21-99, sada, sada viiskümmend, koma, protsent, miinus, ordinals: mostly
  written as the right digits); ettur, lipp, ratsu, vanker, oda, matt, viik, tuld in game lines. Names read well
  as written: Philidori ("filidori"), Caro-Kanni, Tarraschi (heard "tarashi" 3 in 3: the probe had it wrong),
  Marshalli, Rubinsteini, Scheveningeni, Oweni, Horwitzi, Réti, Ponziani, Trompowsky, Torre, Colle, Miesesi,
  Zaragoza, Richter, Bongcloudi, Fromi, Karlsbadi, Smith-Morra, Najdorfi, Rauzeri, Sozini, Winaweri, Traxleri,
  Morphy, Zaitsevi, Staffordi, Aljehhini, Grünfeldi, Pirci, Tšigorini, Svešnikovi, Evansi, Falkbeeri, Pterodaktüli,
  Fiankettovariant.
- Left as is (respelled variant heard no better): Zukertorti ("Sukertorti", the z as s; `Tsukertorti` was heard
  "sugertorti" all the same), Kruijsi (`Kröisi` heard "kreisi", "kruisi" as before), Jobava (`Džobava` heard
  "jobava"), Stonewalli (`Stounvolli` no clearer), Fajarowiczi, Schliemanni (`Šliimanni` the same), Halloweeni
  (read "Halloveeni", recognised anyway), Maróczy (heard "maroks", no candidate close in the probe), Van Geeti (g
  as k), Blackmar-Diemeri. "ee neli" after "välja" or at the start of a line is heard "enel", "lenneli": the
  letter is said (probe), "neli" is what the recogniser loses; "tähtedega aa" melts a little ("tähtetegaa"), but
  the probe keeps the aa (without it +0.71). "reitinguks" is a close call between "reetinguks" and "räitinguks".
- Recogniser habits: squares and numbers as notation ("A6", "F7", "86%"); final -u as -o (sinu "sino", käiku
  "käikoo"; the probe cannot tell them apart); geminates and quantity lost or added (etturi "eturi", lipu "lippu",
  käik "keik"); v as b or p ("palge", "Banker"); words joined across a space ("valgeselitab", "partiikestis"),
  the v of "väljale" lost after "läheb"; English words for names ("Gambit", "Crazy", "Prix" whatever is said);
  "neli" after a vowel written "nedi", "lii".

## Greek

No word needed respelling: `common.lang` has no respell.* entry, and no `.spoken` line was added for the
voice's sake.

| Written | Voice said | Spoken spelling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| the file letter e after "το", "στο", "κίνηση" ("το ε τέσσερα") | often swallowed: no e in about 35 of the 53 e-squares of the 300-line round trip ("το 4"), and no e in 5 of 12 renderings of 4 test lines | left `ε`: with `έ` the e was missing in 7 of 12, and `εε` / `έε` garbled other words of the line. In new lines, put the square after a consonant ("στον", "με") |
| a question mark ";" inside a line ("Πάλι την ίδια κίνηση; Εντάξει...") | read like a semicolon: a short pause, or none at all | fixed in code: the voice front end speaks every Greek ";" as "?" (`tts::text::spokenPunctuation`, see below) |

- Round trip: Parakeet missed 93 % of the words, so the round trip is Whisper medium set to `el`. It covered
  300 lines (seed 0), then 3 seeds on about 60 lines: the reviewers' list, words missed in more than a third of
  their uses (in short carrier sentences), the file letters, and the variants tried for ε.
- Checked and fine: έιτς (two vowels, "έι τς"), α and μπι said alone, γάμμα, Έλο, αν πασάν inside a sentence,
  μπλιτς, ράπιντ, Σερί, ρομπότ, τουρνουά, Ωχ, Ωπ, Αχ, Πω πω, κανόνες, στήλες, Αρχάριος. The elisions are each
  said as one word ("Πάρ’ τον" heard "Πάρτον", "στ’ αλήθεια" heard "σταλήθεια", "Γι’ αυτό"). The voice keeps
  the dialytika: Ταϊμάνοφ, Νιμτσοϊνδική and Μπογκοϊνδική sit next to "Ταημάνοφ", "Νιμτσοηνδική" and "Μπογκο
  ινδική", and far from the digraph readings "Τεμάνοφ" and "Νιμτσιντική" (probe in context, 4 seeds).
  Όιβε is said "Ό-ι-βε", ΜακΚάτσον "Μακ Κάτσον" (not spelled out), and Μπόνγκκλαουντ and Στόουνγουολ come out
  as two syllable groups. επιτίθενται sits next to "επιτίθεντε" (+0.05) and far from "επιτίθεται" (+1.42), and
  the voice says the σ of σκακιέρα, even though Whisper drops both.
- Left as is (close calls; the probe cannot settle stress): φινάλε (Whisper writes "final"), Γκαμπί
  (heard "Γαμπί"; the probe puts "γαμπί" +0.5 against "γκάμπι" +0.95), πτέρυγα (heard "τέρυγα" in 16 of 17
  renderings, though in "στην πτέρυγα" no variant is close), παγίδες (heard "παγιέδες" 3 times in 3; in
  context "πάγιδες" and "παγέδες" are as close as each other). Τζιόκο leans to "Τζι-όκο" over "Τζόκο".
  Μπογκολιούμποφ, Σεβενίνγκεν and Φαγιαρόβιτς came out as ties between stresses. Said alone, "Πατ." is heard
  "Ματ" 3 times in 3, and `Πάτ.` did no better; inside a sentence it is heard right. Χμ and Χμμ get a vowel
  ("Χαμέ", "Καμ"); `Μμ` too ("Μεμ").
- Greek ";" (U+003B, or U+037E, which NFKD folds to U+003B before the voice sees it): at the end of a line the
  voice reads it like "." or "?", with no difference the probe can measure. Inside a line, it reads it as a
  semicolon. The pause after it is 0.01 to 0.19 s, against 0.21 to 0.36 s for "?" or ".", over 5 sentences and
  4 seeds. In "Πάλι την ίδια κίνηση; Εντάξει, ας δούμε." it ran straight into the next sentence in 4 seeds of
  4, and that rendering is closest to the comma version. "?" gives a sentence pause there. 17 catalog lines
  have a ";" inside the line. Greek has no semicolon of its own (it uses the ano teleia ·), so
  `tts::text::spokenPunctuation` turns every ";" and U+037E of Greek text into "?" before chunking. Left as is:
  src/coach/pacing.cpp counts only U+037E as a sentence end, not U+003B, which the Greek catalog uses; it still
  finds the pause there, only with a comma's weight.
- Grammar found on the way: `ex.retake.b6` said "Το ίππος παίρνει στο ε5 παίρνει..." when the reply is a piece
  move. It now follows the analysis convention "η απάντηση {reply}" and uses κερδίζει.
- Recogniser habits: Whisper writes squares as notation (E4, f7, "το 4"), and confuses the letters that sound
  alike (ι/η/υ/ει/οι, ο/ω, ε/αι: "ήπος" for ίππος, "μια" for μία, "και" for κι). It drops the first consonant
  of a cluster (σκακιέρα as "κακιέρα", βαθμολογία as "βασμολογία"), writes loanwords in English ("Bleach",
  "final", "classic chess"), and pads a short line with a repeated phrase ("Τι έχεις; Τι έχεις; ...").

## Finnish

| Written | Voice said | Spoken spelling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Aljehin, Aljehinin | the j dropped: "Alihinin" (probe: nearest of the candidates), heard "Alihinin", "Alihin", "alihene" 8 times in 9 | `Alljehin`, `Alljehinin` (respell.*): the j heard 7 times in 9 ("Aljehin" 6 in 6 in a short line), against 1 in 9 |
| Pircin | with an s: "Pirsin" (probe), heard "piirsin" 2 times in 3 in a short line | `Pirtsin` (respell.pircin): "Pirtsin" 6 in 6, against 4 in 6 |

- Parakeet missed most words; the round trips are Whisper medium set to `fi`: the main one stopped after 111 of
  its 300 lines (seed 0, 1,035 words, 42 % of words missed: Whisper's Finnish, long lines end in loops), then
  3 seeds on 80 lines (the reviewers' list, the file letters in squares and compounds, numbers 11 to 120,
  decimals, the inflected 21 and 71, 75 opening names and eponyms in "Tänään pelattiin X ja Y.", the words
  missed most), 14 lines of A/B variants and 6 of the fixes in game lines; probes (4 seeds) on 24 names and words.
- Checked and fine: the file letters aa, bee, see, dee, ee, äf, gee, hoo (heard as notation; also in "äf-linja",
  "dee-sotilas"), `äl` for the L ("äl-kirjaimen", "äl-hyppyä": "L-kirjaimen", "älyhyppyä"), aasta, hoohon,
  kirjain ee, the numbers (yksitoista to sata, kaksikymmentä, "plus kaksi pilkku kolme", "miinus yksi pilkku
  viisi", kahdellakymmenelläyhdellä, seitsemänkymmenenyhden as the right digits), Hmm (hummed), Auts, Hups
  (probe: nearest "Hhups"; heard "Ops", "Vaps"), shakki (probe: `šakki`, as it should; the recogniser writes
  "sakki"), Elo-luvuksi, epolettimatti, oppositio, valkea, siirrolla, ratsu, torni, lähetti, kuningatar,
  linnoittautua, Caro-Kann, Philidorin, Owenin (probe: "Ouenin"), Horwitzin, Grünfeldin, Rétin ("Reetin"),
  Ponzianin, Tarraschin and Marshallin (š, probe), Schliemannin, Tšigorinin, Nimzowitschin, Nimzo, Bogo,
  Miesesin (long i, probe), Zaragozan, Jobava, Stonewall, Richter-Veresov, Smith-Morra, Grand Prix, Najdorfin
  ("Naidorf" 6 in 6; `Naidorfin` heard no better), Svešnikovin, Kanin, Winawerin, Rubinsteinin, Fegatello,
  Traxlerin, Morphyn, Parhamin (h silent, probe), Halloween, Semi-Tarrasch, Meranin, Sämischin (probe:
  "Sämišin"), Falkbeerin, Englundin, Benkon, Rossolimon, Taimanovin, Alapinin, Panovin, Evansin, Staffordin,
  Grobin, Borgin, Pterodaktyyli, Fianketto, Carlsbad, Fajarowiczin, Maróczy, Breyerin, Zaitsevin (probe:
  "Zajtsevin"), Richter-Rauzer, Milesin, Lucenan, Anastasian, Bullet, Petrovin.
- Left as is: Giuoco is read "gi-uoko" (probe), but Whisper writes "Juoko" either way and `Džuoko`, `Djuoko`
  were heard no better. Birdin is read with the Finnish i ("Birrdin", probe); `Bördin` was heard "pöydän",
  no better. Zukertortin is said with an s (probe: "Sukertortin"), as many Finnish players say it. Scheveningenin
  and Van Geetin are heard badly, with no candidate clearly closer. The file letter aa melts into a word ending
  in a vowel before it ("Paras oli aa neljä" heard "Parasolja 4" 2 times in 3, "Torni aa kahdeksan" "tornia
  8"), but the probe puts the line nearest "oli aaa neljä", the aa said: the recogniser, as in Polish.
- Recogniser habits: squares and numbers as notation ("E4", "21"); shakki written "sakki", "sähkö" or "Chuck";
  valkealla as "valkeilla", siirrolla as "siirralla", "siirolla"; English spellings for loanwords
  ("Gambit", "Halloween"); a long line ends in a loop of one word ("pelaimasta pelaimasta...").

## Dutch

| Written | Voice said | Spoken spelling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fianchetteert | the ch said s or sj: "fiansetteert" (probe), heard "fianceteert", "fiansteert", never with a k in 15 | `fianketteert` (respell): a k heard 7 times in 15 |
| Grand Prix | d and x said: "grant priks" (probe), heard "grondbricks", "krant op riks" | `gran`, `prie` (respell.grand, respell.prix): "Grand Prix" 7 in 9 against 1 in 6 |
| Winawer | the aw said like au: "winauer" (probe), heard "Wienauer" 9 in 9 | `winaver` (respell): "Wienhaver", no au in 6; `wienaawer` still "Wienauer" |
| Fajarowicz | heard "Firewix" 4 in 4 | `fajarovitsj` (respell): "Vajarovits" 2 in 3 |
| coach | the t lost: "koosj" (probe), heard "kosh", "koorts", "koos", "course" | `kootsj` (respell): "coach" 3 in 9 against 1 in 6, otherwise "koots", "codes" (with a t) |
| eenentwintig (21) | first syllable lost: "enentwintig" (probe), heard "in twintig" | `éénentwintig` (number.21.spoken): 21 eleven times in 12 against 7 in 12 |
| Hm. (event.filler, said alone) | with a vowel: "hem" (probe, heard so 2 in 3) | `Hmm.` (event.filler.spoken): "Hmm" 2 in 3. In a sentence "Hm," is fine (3 in 3) and "Hmm." is dropped |

- Parakeet does not do this voice's Dutch: the round trip used Whisper medium set to `nl` (300 lines,
  seed 0), then 3 seeds on about 130 lines (the reviewers' list, file letters, numbers, every eponym in
  "Ik antwoordde met ..., en jij koos voor ...", every fix), and probes. Whisper hallucinates on a word
  alone ("Remise." heard "Mijn meeste", "Pat." "Bakker"): check a name in a sentence.
- Checked and fine: remise ("remieze"; `remieze` heard worse), mat (like "mad"), pat (like "pad"), dame
  ("daame"), gambiet (Dutch g, like "chambiet"), zwart (short a), Au (like "Auw"), Elo, rating, blitz,
  rapid, blunder, super, Perfect, el (the L), aa, ee, Halfgevorderd, vóór, the -zettenregel compounds, 31
  and 71 (accents did no better), Tarrasch and Sämisch (final sch said sj, probe), Aljechin ("aljechien"),
  Réti ("reetie"), Pirc ("pirts"), Miles ("majls"), Caro-Kann, Philidor, Nimzowitsch, Grünfeld, Bogo,
  Owen, Horwitz, Van 't Kruijs, Englund, Benoni, Benko, Bird, Ponziani, Blackmar-Diemer, Trompowsky,
  Torre, Colle, Tsjigorin, Albin, Larsen, Grob, Mieses, Saragossa, Rapport-Jobava, Stonewall, Richter,
  Bongcloud, Alapin, Smith-Morra, Rossolimo, Najdorf, Svesjnikov, Tajmanov, Rubinstein, Panov, Giuoco,
  Evans, Fegatello, Traxler, Morphy, Marshall, Schliemann, Stafford, Parham, Halloween, Falkbeer, Meraner,
  Pterodactylus, Breyer, Zajtsev, Rauzer, Sozin, Maróczy, Karlsbad, Karpov, Botvinnik.
- Left as is: "en passant" is said with the t (probe), but `an passan` and `en passan` were heard no
  better; "en" must not be respelled (the word "and"). "fianchetto" is a close call between k and s
  (probe); `fianketto` was heard worse ("fianket"), as was `fiankettovariant`. "trucs" is read with a
  short u ("truks"); `truuks` was heard the same ("trucks"). "epauletmat" is heard badly either way
  (`epooletmat` no better). `haa` for the h did no better than `ha`. Zukertort keeps its z.
- Recogniser habits: zwart as "zwaard", wit as "het", "dit", "met", zet as "z" (the letter's name), koning
  as "coding", dame as "daam", "duim"; ee as "de", "een"; ha as "A" (A8); gambiet as "gambit", "come
  beat"; Tarrasch as "Taras", -isch as "-ies" (right in Dutch); "min" as "met" after "ongeveer".

## Czech

| Written | Voice said | Spoken spelling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hm, (before a sentence: "Hm, moje hrozba...") | a vowel: heard "Hem", "Hehm", "Hn", or lost (0 hums in 5); the probe puts it nearest "Hem" | `hmm` (respell.hm): hummed 7 times in 9. "Hm." alone was heard as a hum either way |
| fianchetto, fianchetta, fianchettem, fianchetty | the Italian ch as č: "fiančeto" (probe: +0.34, `fianketo` +1.34) | `fianketo`, `fianketa`, `fianketem`, `fiankety` (respell.*): heard with a k 12 times in 12 (Whisper writes "fianchetto" for the plain word whatever is said) |

| Tarraschova, Tarraschovy, Tarraschův, Polotarraschova | s + ch: nearest "Tarasova" (probe +0.68, `Tarašova` +1.74) | `tarašova`...: š heard 6 times in 9 ("Tarašova", "starášovi") |
| Schliemannova, Schliemannův, Sämischova, Sämischův | "Schlijeman", "Semischova" (probe); heard "Shrebanov", "škri manu", "semisková" | `šlímanův`, `zémišova`...: "šlimanův" 6 in 6, "zemišová" 6 in 6 |
| Miesesovo, Kieseritzkého | ie as i-je: "Mijesesovo", "Kijeserického" (probe); heard "měsíce o", "k jezerického" | `mízesovo`, `kízerického`: "Mises" 6 in 6, "kízerického" 6 in 6 |

| Halloweenský | "Haloveenský" (probe +0.18, `Helouvínský` +1.05); heard "halověnský", "halobjenský" | `helouvínský`: "Halloweenský" 5 in 6, against 4 in 6 |
| Grand Prix | d and x said: "Grand Priks" (probe +0.09) | `gran`, `prí` (respell.grand, respell.prix): no x; Whisper writes "Grand Prix" either way |
| Euweho | "Euveho" (probe); heard "uvehlo", "EUV", "EU-vehla" | `éveho`: "éveho" 5 in 6 |
| Rétiho | soft t: "Réťiho" (probe −0.16, `Rétyho` +0.48) | `rétyho`: heard "Rétyho" 6 in 9 (Whisper's y for a hard t) |

- Parakeet missed 73 % of the words on this voice; the main round trip is Whisper medium set to `cs`, 300 lines
  (seed 0, 28 % of 4,519 words missed), then 3 seeds on 97 lines (the reviewers' list, 24 A/B pairs of eponyms in
  "Tohle je X a tohle Y.", 53 more opening names and eponyms in lists, the file letters in squares, the L, numbers,
  the words missed most), and 3 seeds on 30 lines of the fixes in the game's own lines and in opening.say
  sentences, with the plain form beside the doubtful ones; probes (4 to 6 seeds) on about 90 readings.
- Checked and fine: the file letters á bé cé dé é ef gé há (heard as notation), the L (`el`, probe; heard "L"),
  Elo, blitz ("blic"), rapid ("rapit"), rating ("rejting"), Ouha ("ou-ha"), an pasan, „upravuji“, mat (the t said;
  "Mat třetím" merges the two t), tah ("tach"), the numbers (92 %, 12, 13, 17, 19, 21krát, 34, 122, "plus jedna
  čárka tři", "minus nula čárka pět", ordinals). The loanwords keep a hard d, t, n (probe): diagonála, aktivní,
  etiketa, taktika, indická, motivy, tip, Benoni, Poncianiho, Štajnic, pianissimo. Names read well as written:
  Caro-Kann ("Karo"), Fischer ("Fišer"), Schlechter (š), Falkbeer ("Falkbér"), Smith ("Smit"), Bongcloud
  ("Bongklaud"), Breyer ("Brejer", as in Hungarian), Morphy (heard with an f 6 in 6, though the probe leans to a
  p), Owen (heard "Owen" 4 in 6; `Ouenova` 5 in 6, a tie in the probe), Diemer ("Deemer" 3 in 3), Stonewall,
  Trompowského, Horwitz, Torre, Maróczy, Staunton, Evans, Stafford, Parham, Janowski, Botvinnik, Najdorf,
  Svešnikov, Rossolimo, Traxler, Englund, Jobava, Richter-Veresov, Rauzer, Sozin, Pterodaktylí, Bogoljubov,
  Tartakower, Paulsen, Anderssen, Keres, Lasker, Lange, Nimcovič, Čigorin, Zajcev, Alapin, Aljechin, Petrosjan,
  Spasskij, Kasparov, Karpov, Averbach, Bronštejn, Saragosa, Leningrad, Meran, From, Pirc, Borg, Grob, Sokolskij,
  Albin, Tajmanov, Kan, Smyslov, Tal, Petrov, Panov, Winawer, Benko, Fegatello.
- Left as is: partie, partii, partiích lean to a soft t alone and in "Dobrá partie!" but are ties or hard in other
  contexts (probe, 7 contexts); `partyje` was heard "partie je" once in 3. kandidátní and kritický are ties
  between hard and soft. Colle is said "Koleův" (the e said; probe −0.97), and `Kolův` was heard no better.
  Jaenisch ("Ja-eniš"), McCutcheon ("Mekučeon"), Van't Kruijs ("Krujs"), Van Geet ("Gét"), Bird ("Birdovo"),
  Scheveningen (near "Sceveningenská") and Blackmar are read as spelled: `Jénišův`, `Mekačenova`, `Krajsovo`,
  `Chétovo`, `Bérdovo`, `Ševeningenská` and `Blekmar` were heard no better. The h-file after a vowel melts
  into the word ("pole há osm" heard "polehá osm", "polená 8"): Czech h is voiced, as said; "tah á tři" is heard
  "tahá tři" the same way.
- Recogniser habits: Whisper writes voicing assimilation as heard (jezdcem "jestcem", zpět "z pět", then "z 5"),
  Slovak and colloquial forms (pěšec "piešec", jezdci "jazdci", rychlý "rychlej", navrhuju "navrhuji"), the
  wrong vowel length (pružné "průžné", pořadí "pořádí") and y for i (figurami "figurámy"), tvůj as "svůj" or
  "tvoj", squares and numbers as notation ("D5", "polehá 8"), splits and joins ("proti gambit", "hra je", "boju
  je"), and known names in their own spelling ("Halloween", "Grand Prix", "Marshal", "Steinitz") whatever the
  voice says: check a name with the probe. A line's first word after a colon is often lost.

## Romanian

| Written | Voice said | Spoken spelling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| en passant | "ien pasant", with the t: heard "Ien pasant", "pasand", "pasunt", a t 5 times in 6 | `an pasan` (respell.en, respell.passant): no t 8 times in 9 ("an pasan", "anpasan") |
| Pirc | "pirk" (probe: Pirk +0.03, Pirț +3.20), heard "PIRC" 3 times in 3 | `pirț` (respell): "Pirtz", "pierți" 2 in 3 |

| Bird | as written (probe: Börd, Bărd far), heard "bieurde", "biurt" | `bărd` (respell): "bărdă", "băt", "Bird" |
| Ponziani | with a z (probe: Ponțiani +0.96), heard "Ponsiani", "ponzian" | `ponțiani` (respell): "Pontian", "Pontiani" 3 in 3 |
| Lange (Max Lange) | the g of "ger" (probe: nearest "Lanje"), heard "Lunge" 2 times in 3 | `langhe` (respell): "Langa" 3 in 3 |
| Grand Prix, Halloween | the d and the x (probe: nearest "Gran Prics", +5 from "Gran Pri"); w as v ("Haloveen") | `gran`, `pri`, `helouin` (respell): Whisper writes "Grand Prix", "Halloween" 3 times in 3 either way |

- Parakeet missed 73% of the words; the round trips are Whisper medium set to `ro`: 300 lines (seed 0; a third of the
  words come back wrong even with the diacritics ignored), then 3 seeds on 35 lines (the reviewers' list, file letters,
  the L, numbers, the words missed most, A/B variants) and on 9 pairs of lines of eponyms with their respellings, 1 seed
  on 19 lines holding the other opening names and eponyms, and probes (4 seeds) for every name and doubtful word.
- Checked and fine: regele (probe: the g of "ger"; "regile" is the recogniser's), "litera e" and "pe e patru" (probe:
  nearest "é", not "ie"), a be ce de ef ge haș (C4, D5 3 in 3, "a trei" 3 in 3), le for the L, the numbers (11, 14, 34,
  "șaptezeci și una", "nouăzeci și nouă", "plus unu virgulă cinci", written as the right digits), Hm (probe: "Hmm"),
  Uau (one syllable, probe), Elo (one word, not "ie-lo" nor letters), blitz, tempo, Mut-o, Câștig-o (probe:
  "Muto", "Câștigo"), Hopa (h said), o sută, Philidor ("Filidor"), Grünfeld ("Grünfelt"), Schliemann ("Șliman" in
  context), Tarrasch ("Taraș"), Trompowsky, Owen ("Ouen"), Horwitz, Réti, Richter ("Rihter"), Smith ("Smit"), Morphy
  ("Morfi"), Maróczy (heard "Maroții" 3 in 3), Sämisch ("Semiș"), Bongcloud, Traxler, Carlsbad, Steinitz, Rubinstein,
  Marshall, and in the round trip Caro-Kann, Alehin, Alapin, Taimanov, Sveșnikov, Rossolimo, Meran, Evans, Richter-Rauzer,
  Sozin, From, Zaițev, Cigorin, Botvinnik, Bogoliubov, Richter-Veresov, Pterodactil, Hipopotam, Torre, Englund.
- Left as is: fianchetto leans to "fiancetto" in the probe (alone and in "face fianchetto cu"), but was heard with a k
  ("anchetă") and `fianketto` did no better (one "fianchetto" in 3 each). Scheveningen is read "skeveningen" (probe);
  `Șeveninghen` was heard the same ("cheveningă"). Stonewall is read "stonevall", but heard "Stonewall" 2 in 3 and
  `Stounuol` worse; Jobava (the j of "joc") and Miles ("mi-les") were heard no better as `Giobava` and `Mails`.
  Nimzowitsch and Zukertort keep a z (heard "nimzovic", "zucărtort"), as many Romanian players say them; Colle keeps its
  e ("Cole", probe); Breyer is a close call ("Breier"). A line-initial "Șah" before a word loses its h ("Șah dublu" near
  "Șa dublu", probe; heard "Dacă dublu", "Ce-a înseamnă" 5 times in 6), with no other spelling; inside a line and in
  "Șah mat" the h is said. The u of "mutare" is heard "o" about one time in three ("motare"); the probe cannot tell u from
  o, and `muutare` did no better. "pioni" ends with a vowel heard (probe near "pionă"), heard "pion" or "pionii";
  "partide", "partidele" are heard "partii de", "partitele" nearly always (a tie in the probe). câmp is said close to
  "cămp" (probe); "cîmp" is read otherwise.
- Recogniser habits: it drops the diacritics (ș, ț, â, ă; ş with a cedilla), writes Negrul as "Negru-l", a line-initial
  "Dama" as "Da, ma" (the probe has "Dáma"), "dama ta" as "damata", "Hopa" as "Opa", regele as "regile", Albul as
  "Arbul", squares and numbers as notation ("F7", "30 și 4"); it drops a line's first words and loops on some long lines
  ("adesea adesea ...").

## Hungarian

| Written | Voice said | Spoken spelling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fianchetto, fianchettóba, fianchettókkal, fianchettós, fianchettót, fianchettóval | the Italian ch as cs: "fiancsetto" (probe −0.63); heard with a k 0 times in 8 ("fiancettóba", "fjancsettóba") | `fianketto`, `fiankettóba`... (respell.*, one per form): k heard 15 times in 21 |

| Aljechin | ch as k: "Aljekin" (probe, in a sentence); heard "a jekin", "aljekhinn" (k 2 in 3) | `aljehin`: h 5 in 6, never k |

| Larsen, Anderssen, Janowski, Trompowsky, Veresov, Saragossa, Rossolimo, Hippopotamus, Evans | s as the Hungarian s [ʃ] (probe: "Andersen", "Janovski", "Verezsov", "Saragosza", "Hipopotamus", "Evanzs"); heard "saragos a", "hip-hop-ot a most" | `larszen`, `anderszen`, `janovszki`, `trompovszki`, `vereszov`, `szaragossza`, `rosszolimo`, `hippopotamusz`, `evansz`: sz heard 5 in 6 (Larsen, Anderssen, Janowski against 1 in 3, Veresov), 2 in 3 (Saragossa, Trompowsky); Whisper writes "Evans", "Rosso Limo" either way |

- Parakeet missed 59 % of the words on this voice. The main round trip is Whisper medium set to `hu`: 300 lines
  (seed 0), with 28 % of 4,560 words missed. Then 3 seeds on 108 lines: the reviewers' list, the plain form
  beside each respelling, file letters, numbers and coach lines. Then 3 seeds on 20 lines of opening names in the
  game's own sentences, and 3 seeds on 6 lines of üt against `űt`. About 100 readings were probed.
- Checked and fine (probe or round trip): Philidor ("Filidor"), Caro–Kann (the dash makes no pause), Tarrasch
  ("Taras"), Richter ("Rihter"), Morphy ("Morfi"), Fischer ("Fiser"), Schlechter ("Slehter"), Horwitz ("Horvic"),
  Bongcloud ("Bongklaud"), Marshall, Rubinstein, Tartakower, Steinitz, Breyer, Paulsen, Max Lange, Parham, Smith,
  Traxler, Fegatello, Pterodactyl, Colle ("Kolle"), Geet ("Gét"), Scheveningen, scheveningeni, karlsbadi, and
  pianissimo ("pianiszimo"). Lasker and Keres keep the Hungarian s, as players say them. Also fine: rapid,
  Hmm (hummed), El alakban, atól háig, Élő-pontszám, oppozíció, kontra, Filidor-védelemmel, „igazítok”
  (the quotes are not read), tartsd (said "tarcsd", the native assimilation), the file letters C6 D7 G2,
  h-vonal, g-gyalog, the numbers 71 %, 92 %, −1,5, 2,3, 34., 112, 12., 21., and 11 to 99 heard as digits.
- Respellings that were tried and dropped, each heard no better or worse than the plain word:
  - Zukertort as `cukertort`: heard "Kukertort" 3 in 3; the plain word is heard "Zukertolt".
  - Nimzowitsch as `nimcovics`: garbled 6 in 6; the plain word is heard "Nimzovics".
  - Fajarowicz as `fajarovics`: heard "Fire Robics".
  - Spielmann as `spílman`: heard "Spirma".
  - Sämisch as `zémis`: the z joins the article, heard "az émis"; the plain word is heard "szem is".
  - Miles as `májlz`: the plain word is heard "Myles" 3 in 3.
  - Stonewall as `sztónvol`, Blackmar as `blekmár`, Greco, Jaenisch: no better than the plain word.
- Left as is:
  - sakk is heard "sok", "shot", "sők" in every round (24 in 24). The probe puts it apart from "Sokk" and
    "Säkk", and there is no other way to spell it.
  - "Van" (Van't Kruijs, Van Geet) comes from the shared opening names and is also the verb "van" (143 lines),
    so it cannot be respelled.
  - üt and ütök are heard "öt" and "ötök". `űt` was heard as "visszaült" or "visszaölt" (rt3), so it was not
    better.
  - The voice's r is heard as l at times ("vezélet").
  - A short u is heard as o ("centromot", "bábo"); the probe shows a tie.
  - mögötte is heard "megötte".
  - áll at a pause is heard "el"; the probe shows a tie.
  - The file letter a melts into the word before it when that word ends in a consonant ("huszár a hat" heard
    "huszára halt"). Writing á would name the wrong letter.
- Recogniser habits: Whisper writes squares and numbers as notation, ty as tj ("bástják"), and doubles or drops
  consonants ("husszár", "szillárd", "opozíció"). It gets í/i and ú/u length wrong. It writes known names in
  their own spelling whatever is said (Evans, Trompowsky, Grand Prix, Halloween, Stafford, Saragossa), so check
  a name with the probe. It hears "a Sz…" as "az" and splits words ("veszi célba" as "veszít szélba"). It often
  loses the first word of a short line.

## Indonesian

| Written | Voice said | Spoken spelling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fianchetto (and Varian Fianchetto) | the c of "cari": heard "Vian Ceto", "fianceto", "Vian C-37" 3 times in 3, "viancetto", "sian chetel" in the first round trip (probe: nearest "fiancetto", "fiansyetto") | `fianketo` (respell.fianchetto): "fianketo", "Vian Keto", a k 9 times in 9 (`fianketto` the same) |
| Capablanca | the same c: heard "capa belanja", "pencapa belanca" 3 times in 3 (probe: nearest "Capablanka") | `kapablanka` (respell): "kapa belangka", "Kampablanka" 3 in 3 |
| Giuoco (Piano, Pianissimo) | a syllable too many, "ji-u-o-ko" (probe: nearest "Jiuoco"), heard "dua kopiano", "diwaku piano" | `juoko` (respell): "Joko Piano", "Joko Pianissimo" 5 in 6 |
| blunder | as written, "blun-der": heard "blunder" 4 times in 9, "belum dah", once "Blender" (probe: far from "blander"), where Indonesian players say the English word | `blander` (respell): "blander" 5 in 9, "blender" 3, never "blunder" |
| Elephant (Gambit Elephant) | the t said, the ph once a p: "Elefant", "elepant" | `elefan` (respell): "elefan" 3 in 3, "Elephant" 3 in 3 in "Aku membuka dengan Gambit Elefan" |
| Grand Prix | the x said (probe: nearest "Gran Priks", +5 from "Gran Pri") | `pri` (respell.prix): Whisper writes "Grand Prix" 3 times in 3 either way |
| huruf e (lesson.welcome.wrong) | the letter alone: heard "ini", "I", "rofi", "E" once in 6 | `huruf é` (.spoken): "huruf E" 4 in 6 |

- Round trip over 300 lines (Whisper medium set to `id`, seed 0), then 3 seeds on about 120 lines: the words
  missed in more than a third of their uses, the reviewers' list, the file letters and the L, the numbers, A/B
  variants of every candidate, 8 opening names in carrier sentences, and every fix in real lines; 1 seed on
  32 lines holding 95 other opening names and eponyms; probes (3-4 seeds) for 70 names and the doubtful words.
  The voice reads Latin letters with their Indonesian values (c is "ch", j "dj"), but it knows
  most chess names: check a new eponym with a c, ch, gi or x first.
- Checked and fine: skak (probe: "ska(k)", no vowel added; Whisper writes "sekak", "Ska", "Scott"), skakmat, en
  passant (said without the t: "enpasan", "empasan" 6 in 6; `ang pasang`, `an pasan` no better), pat (probe:
  nearest "Pet", "Pad"), el for the L ("huruf L" 5 in 6; `él` the same), a and ha said alone, the numbers (64, 11,
  19, 37, 99, 118, langkah ke-12, ke-34, ke-19, plus dua koma tiga, minus satu koma lima, 92 persen: written as the
  right digits), Elo, rating, blitz, tempo, momen, epolet, remis, rokade (the final é said: "Rokadeh"; `rokadé` no
  better), lho, Hmm, "saya rapikan", "Lima plus tiga" (5+3). Names: Caro (probe: = "Karo"), Colle ("Kol"), Greco,
  Chigorin, Philidor ("Filidor"), Morphy ("Morfi"), Bird ("Berd"), Diemer, Mieses ("Mises"), Richter ("Rikhter"),
  Alekhine (heard "Alehin" 3 in 3; `Alekhin` no better), Najdorf ("Night Dwarf", "Najdorf"; `Naidorf` no better),
  Carlsbad ("Karlsbad"), Sveshnikov, Scheveningen ("Syeveningen"), Schliemann, Schlechter, Steinitz, Rubinstein,
  Kieseritzky, Zaitsev, Averbakh, Petrosian, Smyslov, Spassky, Kasparov, Paulsen, Zukertort, Horwitz, Trompowsky,
  Ponziani, Blackmar, Traxler, Falkbeer, Stafford, Evans, Owen, Pterodaktil (p silent), Ruy Lopez, Bongcloud,
  Stonewall, Saint George, Staunton, Max Lange, Breyer, Janowski, Grünfeld, Leningrad, Fajarowicz, Miles.
- Left as is: the file letter e is weak before "empat" (heard "yang empat", "Y4", "I4"): E heard 7 times in 42,
  the letter lost twice; `é` was heard E 7 times in 36 but lost 9 times, `è` 9 in 36 (lost 4), `E` 2 in 12. After
  "pion" it comes through ("pion e lima" 2 in 3). Ups is said "aps" (heard "Aps" 6 in 6; probe unstable over
  seeds); `Uups` was heard "Waps". Kruijs is read "Kruis" (probe), but `Krais` was heard no better ("pancris"
  against "pancruise"). Fried Liver ("Fraid", heard "Fright Lever"; `Fraid Lifer` no better), Tarrasch (no
  candidate close; heard "Taras"), Sämisch ("Samis", heard "semis"), Winawer (w said, "win hour"), Parham (h
  said), Maróczy ("Marochi", a close call with "Marotsi"), Euwe, Bogoljubow and Jaenisch (garbled, no candidate).
- Recogniser habits: it writes squares and numbers as notation and a lone e as "yang" ("yang 4"); it splits -ku
  and -mu ("kuda ku", "langkah mu"), writes tahu as "tau", lho as "loh", klub as "club", Sisilia as "Sicilia",
  pat as "empat" or "But", skak as "sekak" or "sekar"; it garbles the first word of a line on some seeds ("Putih"
  as "Hoti", "Butuh") and invents text for one-word lines (an eponym alone).

## Vietnamese

| Written | Voice said | Spoken spelling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| the file letter g (squares: "giê bảy") | inside a sentence, the diphthong of "giết": "Tượng ở dia bảy", "Mã diễn năm" (probe: "Tượng ở giê bảy" nearest "di bảy", "dê bảy" farthest); heard "dìa", "diễn", "giới", "yên" 12 times in 33 | `dê` (respell.giê), how the letter's name sounds: 3 times in 33 |
| the file letter a (squares, "từ a đến hát") | after a vowel it melts into it: "Đen đi a sáu" heard "Đen đìa sáu", "ô a sáu" heard "O6", "ra a năm" heard "ra à năm" | `A` in capital (file.a.spoken, lesson.welcome.files.spoken): the letter heard 23 times in 33 against 11; the probe puts "A" next to a long "a a", not "ây" |
| Winawer | the English w: "Wienauer", "Weenauer", "WeNower" (8 of 9) | `Vinaver` (respell): "V-never", "Viennese", "B-never", a v or b 4 times in 6 |

| Grand Prix | the x said (probe: nearest "Priks", "Pri" far) | `Pri` (respell.prix): still heard "Grand Prix" 3 times in 3 |

- Main round trip: 300 lines (Whisper medium set to `vi`, seed 0), 36% of the words missed, most of them in lines
  the recogniser garbled or replaced with a phrase of its own ("Cảm ơn các bạn đã xem video"). Then 3 seeds on 144
  lines: the file letters in two contexts each, the L, the numbers, ordinals, decimals and percentages, the
  reviewers' list, 113 opening names and eponyms in "Hôm nay chúng ta học X, Y và Z.", the coach lines missed most,
  A/B variants of each fix; and probes (4 seeds). The opening texts take the capital A when
  tools/gen_opening_lang.py runs again (respell.* apply to them already).
- Checked and fine: e, bê, ép, hát (as notation: E4, B5, F7, H8), xê (heard "xe" 5 times in 6, the probe puts it
  next to "sê"), đê (heard "đây", "đề", D1), "e-lờ" (L 6 times in 6), Elo, Philidor ("Philido", no r, 6 in 6),
  Robot, Hừm ("Hừng", "Ừm"), Ối ("Ôi"), the quote marks (not said), 11 to 98, "thứ nhất", "thứ hai mươi tư",

  "Tan"), Giuoco ("Joko"), Caro-Kann, Zukertort ("du-kơ-tốt"), Trompowsky ("Chom-", the Vietnamese tr), Réti
  (the Vietnamese r: "Jetty"), and the other names of the list, heard close to their spelling.
- Left as is: Tartakower, Nimzowitsch, Trompowsky, Horwitz (the w: close calls in the probe, "Tartakover" heard
  "TataCover" both ways), Fajarowicz (garbled either way), "ghim" (heard "game" 3 times in 3; no candidate closer
  in the probe), the tones the recogniser hears otherwise (Mã as "má", Hậu as "hầu", cộng as "cổng"), "mươi"
  heard as "mười" now and then ("bảy mươi mốt" as "bảy 11"), "Tượng" starting a sentence heard "Tựa". Some long
  lines come out garbled at some seeds (lines with ":" or ";" lose 40-46% of their words against 28-30%).
- Recogniser habits: squares as notation ("ô e bốn" as "OE4"), ê as e ("êm đềm" as "em đềm", xê as "xe"), the
  tones, tr/ch and d/gi/r merged ("trừ" as "chứ", "giành" as "dành"), "bắc cầu" as "bắt cầu", short lines and
  interjections dropped or replaced, loops on long lines ("tượng tượng tượng"), names in English spellings
  ("Civilization" for Scheveningen).

| Hm, (before a sentence) | lost, or with a vowel ("Hehm", "Chm"): hummed 2 times in 9 | `hmm` (respell.hm): hummed 15 times in 15. "Hm." alone is heard "Hmm" either way |
| rating | as written, "ratink" (probe +0.55, `rejting` +1.36) | `rejting`, as Slovak players say it (Whisper writes "rating" either way) |

| Van Geetovo, Van't Kruijsovo | "Gétovo" (probe −0.49), "Kruisovo" (+0.26); heard "Vanguitovo", "Cruisové" | `chétovo`, `krajsovo`: no g 6 in 6 ("vanchetová", "Khetovou"), no u 6 in 6 ("Kreisová", "Krijsovou") |

- Parakeet missed 79 % of the words on this voice; the main round trip is Whisper medium set to `sk`, 300 lines
  (seed 0, 41 % of 4,482 words missed). Then 3 seeds on 60 lines (8 contexts of the file letter e with `é`, `éé`
  and `E`, Hm against Hmm, the reviewers' coach lines, the L, the numbers), on 32 lines of names (the plain and the
  respelled form in separate lines: with both in one line Whisper repeats its first transcription), on 23 lines of
  the fixes in the game's lines and opening.say sentences, and on 4 of them with the plain "é"; probes (4 seeds) on
  about 95 readings. The synthesis is the same for the same text and seed: a line already run is not worth running
  again.
- Checked and fine (probe or round trip): biely ("bieli"), ťah, kráľ, stĺpec (the syllabic ĺ), môj ("muoj"),
  mat and pat (a hard t: `mať` +1.69), partia (a hard t), joj, ef, strelec, jednu, dopredu, bielopoľného; the
  loanwords keep a hard d, t, n (probe against `ďiagonála`, `takťika`...): materiál, teória, téma, diagonála,
  indická, systém, moderný, taktika, kritický, tempo, aktivita, etiketa, motívy, iniciatíva, kandidátske, Benoni;
  and tento, jeden stay hard. The L (`el`, heard "L" 6 in 6), "od á po há", the numbers (64, 75, 50, 71 %, 12,
  13, 19, 122, "plus jeden koma tri", "mínus nula koma päť"), "v štvrtom ťahu" (6 in 6: "vo" is not needed), Ups,
  Ojoj, Fíha, Ó, Elo, Expert, rapid, „upravujem“ (the quotes are not read), epoletový. Names read well as
  written: Caro-Kann ("Karokán" 3 in 3), Rétiho (`rétyho` no better), Maróczyho ("Marocího" 3 in 3), Winawer
  ("Vináverov"), Morphyho ("morfiho"), Colleho ("koleho"), Horwitz ("horvic"), Trompowského, Janowského, Breyer
  ("Brejer", as in Hungarian), Staunton, Blackmar, Bongcloud ("bongklaud"), pianissimo, Fegatello. The
  Russian names are already in Slovak spelling (Aljechin, Čigorin, Nimcovič).
- Left as is (close calls, the respelling heard no better): Diemer (`dímerov`), Tartakower (`tartakoverov`),
  Fischer (`fišerov`), Marshall (nearest "Marschalov" in the probe, but heard "maršálov" in the main round trip; Whisper
  writes "Marshallov" for both forms). Stonewall is said letter by letter ("Stonevall", probe), but `stounvol`
  was heard "útok z Tom-Vol" (the s joins "útok"): no better. Bird ("Bírdovo") is read as written. The file letter
  at the start of a line is lost with `é`, `éé` and `E` alike (Whisper drops a line's first word). The h-file after
  a vowel melts into the word ("pole há osem" heard "poleha 8"), as in Czech; "od á po há" is written "apoha".
- Recogniser habits: Whisper writes Czech forms and vowel lengths (bielý, čierný, král, figura, solidná, začíná,
  sicilská, tvojej as "svojej"), ť as č or "ti" (tiach, čah), ľ as l, ĺ as "stolpec" or "stúpec", mat as "mať",
  pat as "pac", final -ou as -ov (dámov), voicing assimilation as heard (zaz získava), squares and numbers as
  notation ("dp5", "cp5" for dé päť, cé päť), "ef sedem" as "Epsedem", splits and joins (do predu, na miesto), and
  known names in their own spelling (Marshallov, Fischerová, Stonewall, Grand Prix, Halloween) whatever the voice
  says: check a name with the probe.

## Croatian

| Written | Voice said | Spoken spelling |

| the file letter a (squares) | runs into the word before it: "To je a šest" heard "To je šest" 3 times in 3, "na a šest" heard "na šest" 3 in 3 (the probe puts "na a šest" next to "naa šest") | `aa` (file.a.spoken): heard as the a-file 8 times in 21 against 3 in 15 ("To je aa šest" 3 in 3; after "na" still often "na šest"); the probe puts "na aa šest" far from "na šest" (+1.06, "na a šest" +0.43) |
| Ups! | heard "Ips" 3 times in 6; no candidate near in the probe | `uups` (respell): "Ups" 6 in 6 |
| en passant | "en pasant", the t said (probe; heard with a t 11 times in 12) | `pasan` (respell.passant): a t 1 time in 12. "an" for "en" was swallowed more often (heard 4 in 9), so "en" stays |
| obrnutim | the long u said like an o: "obrnotim" (probe), heard with o or a 7 times in 9 | `obrnuutim`: u 6 in 6 |
| Šah znači (ann.check.coach.first.2) | runs together: heard "Šak znači" 6 times in 6 (the probe puts it near "Šag", "Šak") | `Šah, znači` (.spoken): "Šah" 3 in 3 |

| Birdovo, Milesova, McCutcheon(ov) | as Croatian letters (probe: "Bird", "Milesova", "Makkačon") | `berdovo`, `majlsova`, `mekačon`: heard "berdovo", "Melsova", "mekačan" 2 in 3 each |
| Stonewall, Stonewalla, Grand Prix | the e said ("Stonevala", probe); the d and the x said ("Priks", probe) | `stounvol(a)`, `gran`, `pri`: two syllables ("ston vol", "Stonvola"); no x 2 in 3 (Whisper writes "Stonewall", "Grand Prix" for both) |

- Parakeet missed 84 % of the words on this voice: the main round trip is Whisper medium set to `hr`, 300 lines (seed 0,
  15 % of 4,488 words missed), then 3 seeds on 80 lines (the reviewers' list, 18 A/B pairs of opening names in "Na
  ploči je X, a zatim Y.", the file letters in hard positions with A/B variants, the L, numbers, the words missed
  most), and on 53 lines of fixes in the game's own lines with the plain form beside the doubtful ones; probes (4
  seeds) on about 150 readings. Eponyms get every possessive form the composed opening names make ("{X:gen}a
  varijanta", "{X:gen}o otvaranje").
- Checked and fine: the letters be ce de ef ge (heard as notation), ha ("poljeha osam" 5 in 6; `haa` 6 in 6,
  too close to call), el, Hmm (hummed), Vau, Oh, Joj, Bravo, Elo, rejting ("rating"), šah alone and "Daj šah" (probe:
  `šak` +3.24), crni, bijeli (the ije diphthong, probe near "bjeli", as spoken Croatian has it), žrtva, the numbers
  (jedanaest to devetnaest, 34., 47., 64, 68, 92 and 100 posto, plus jedan zarez pet, minus nula zarez tri). Names
  read well as written: Caro-Kann ("Karo", probe), Philidor and Morphy (f), Owen ("Ouenova", probe), Horwitz (c),
  Réti, Winawer and Tartakower (v), Marshall, Traxler (ks), Scheveningenska (š), Schliemann (heard "Šlimanova"),
  Richter (h), Rauzer, Bongcloud ("Bongklaud"), Trompowsky, Torre ("Torijov", the glide), Fischer, Schlechter,
  Stafford, Smith-Morrin ("Smit"), Breyer ("Brejer"), Janowski, Staunton, Max Lange, Anderssen, Paulsen, Fegatello,
  Najdorf, and the Russian names in Croatian spelling.
- Left as is: the file letter e after a vowel gets a glide ("polje e četiri" heard "polje je četiri"; `ee` heard as
  e 2 times in 9). Nimzo-Larsenov (`Nimco` heard "Nimko" 3 in 3) and nimzoindijska keep the z. Van't Kruijsovo and
  Van Geetovo (`Krajsovo` heard "Christ'o", "Crysovo"; `Hetovo` "Hat'o"), Halloween (`Helovin` heard "Helving",
  "hell of a"), Fajarowiczeva and Blackmar (`Fajarovičeva`, `Blekmar`) were heard no better than as written.
  pogreška and its forms are close calls: heard "pograšku", "pogroške" 7 times in 18, 4 of them on one seed (probe:
  `pograške` −0.18). napadnut(a) has the same o-like u (probe), but `napadnuuta` did no better (o 2 in 3). "Damin
  gambit" is heard "Damien", "damning" (probe near "Damen"); `Damiin` the same. epoletni after "zove" loses its e
  ("zove poletni"), the vowels meeting. "{move}, šah" before a word was not judged.
- Recogniser habits: Whisper writes ije and je loosely (bjeli, pobijeda, svjetla), Italian and English spellings
  ("variante", "fianchetto", "rating", "Remy", "Halloween", "Grand Prix", "Stonewall", "Capablanca"), č for ć and back,
  m as b ("daba", "pobakni"), a final u as o now and then (napadnot, otvoreno), squares and numbers as notation
  ("na a šest" as "na 6", "e" after a vowel as "je"), and a known name in its own spelling whatever the voice says:
  check a name with the probe.

| rating | the letters: "ra-ting" (probe: `rejting` +1.03, `ratink` +1.14) | `rejting` (respell): heard "rejting" 3 times in 15, never in 9 for "rating" (Whisper writes "rating" for both) |

- Parakeet missed 97 % of the words on this voice; the main round trip is Whisper medium set to `sl`, 300 lines
  (seed 0, 45 % of 4,555 words missed). Then 3 seeds on 52 lines (the words missed most, the file letters in 13
  squares, the L, numbers, the reviewers' coach lines, "e" / "é" / "ee" in 3 contexts), on 50 lines (17 pairs of
  opening names in "Tvoja otvoritev je X, moj odgovor pa Y.", plain and respelled in separate lines, "an pasan" /
  "en pasan", "Hmm", 4 more contexts of "e" / "ee"), on 37 lines of the fixes in the game's lines and in
  opening.say sentences, and on 12 lines of "e" / "ee" after "na"; probes (4 seeds) on 80 readings, LPC
  formants of "beli".
- Checked and fine: kadar (the r said: `kadarr` −0.10, `kada` +0.95; Whisper writes the Croatian "kada"), kjer,
  ničesar, skakači (č, not t), išči, manj ("man", as said), jemanja, trdnjava ("tərdnjava"), remijem, remi (stress
  on the i: `remí` −0.32), lovec, mata, pat, tvoj, the file letters a be ce de ef ge ha (heard as notation), the L
  (`el`, heard "L"), the numbers (92 %, 71 %, 75, "plus dva vejica tri", "minus ena vejica pet"), Elo, Vau,
  raženj, epoletni ("Poletni": the first vowel melts into "je"), Briljantno. Names read well as written:
  Philidor (f, `filidorjeva` +0.13), Ponziani (c: `poncianijeva` −0.25), Horwitz, Van't ("vant"), Trompowsky,
  Colle / Collov (k: "kolov" 3 in 3), Richter (`rihter` +0.12), Bongcloud (`bongklaud` +0.06), Smith (`smit`),
  Winawer (v), Traxler (ks), Morphy (f), Stafford, Maróczy, Breyer ("Brejer", as in Hungarian), Tartakower,
  Janowski, Max, Réti, and the Russian names, already in Slovenian spelling (Aljehin, Čigorin, Nimcovič,
  Svešnikov, Bronštejn).
- Left as is: beli, belega, meri are heard "bili", "miri" (28 times in 37 for beli in the main round trip; the
  probe ties `bili` and `béli`): the first vowel of "beli" has F1 about 290 Hz, against 230 for "bili" and 550 for
  an open "bèli", the high closed e of standard Slovenian, and no spelling lies between. tokrat (closed o, the
  probe ties `tukrat`) likewise. Marshall (probe: `marshalov` +0.31, `maršalov` +0.55; heard "Marshalo" either
  way), Scheveningen and Schlechter (the probe leans to "sč" and "s", but Whisper hears "ševeningenska" and
  "šlikter" with or without the respelling), Euwe ("evjeva" either way, `evejeva` no better), Blackmar
  (`blakmar` +0.24, an accepted reading; Whisper writes "Black" for both), Parham (said with its h; no candidate
  near). The file letter stays a close call: "ee" is heard better overall and at the start of a line (where the
  moves of the review lines stand), "e" after "vzame na" ("skakač vzame na ee pet" heard "v zamena je 5"); both
  are heard "je" after "polje", "polju", "kmeta".
- Recogniser habits: Whisper writes Croatian forms (kada, centar, lovac, uzame for vzame, prejde for preide,
  potes, bili), the syllabic r with a vowel (černi, žertev, tərdnjava as "trnjava"), squares and numbers as
  notation and joined ("E4", "depet", "apet", "je 4" for "e štiri" after a vowel), splits and joins ("po meni",
  "na mestu", "na tačnost"), known names in their own spelling ("Greco", "Fischer", "Halloween", "Grand Prix",
  "Stonewall", "rating") whatever the voice says: check a name with the probe. A line's first word is often lost
  or misheard ("Pat." heard "Vat", "Bat").

| Grand Prix (uzbrukums) | the d and the x said: "Grand Priks" (probe +0.20, `Grān Prī` +2.26) | `grān`, `prī` (respell.grand, respell.prix): read like "Gran Prī" (probe −0.33); Whisper writes "Grand Prix" for the plain form, "Grānu prī", "Grāmbrī" for this one |

- Parakeet missed 99 % of the words on this voice. The main round trip is Whisper medium set to `lv`: 300 lines (seed 0).
  It missed 60 % of the words, or 19 % once diacritics, doubled letters and notation are ignored. Then 3 seeds on 56
  lines: A/B pairs of the file letters in 18 contexts, the reviewers' coach lines, Hm against Hmm, and the words
  missed most. Then 1 seed on 34 lines naming every opening name and eponym, and 3 seeds on 18 lines of the fixes in
  the game's own lines and the numbers. About 30 readings were probed (4 seeds).
- Checked and fine: the letters bē, cē, dē, gā (heard as notation) and ef ("F7"; "ef septiņi" heard "epseptiņi",
  the assimilation as said); hā (heard "kā" or "H8": the velar Latvian h); `el` for the L (probe: nearest "l";
  heard "el", "elu" or joined to "burta" 5 times in 6). Also fine:
  - šahs and šaha: probe nearest "šaka", "šaga" in "Šis ir šaha pulkstenis", the velar h. Whisper writes "šaks".
  - dubultšahs, kandidātgājienus, nosmacētais, epoletu (probe: near "epaletu").
  - pats ("pats" 6 in 6), Ups (3 in 3), Ai (probe "Aj"), Oho, Čau (probe "Čao" +0.02).
  - Elo (probe: nearest "elu", not letters; heard "elo" 2 in 3), „Es pielaboju” (the quotes are not read).
  - the numbers: 21, 34, 71 %, 92 %, 12., 21., 34., "mīnus viens komats pieci", "simt divdesmit divi",
    "numur divpadsmit". Each is heard right, as words or digits, in at least 2 renderings of 3.
  - The names are in Latvian spelling and are read as written: Karo-Kanna, Filidora, Cukertorta, Nimcoviča,
    Aļehīna, Grīnfelda, Ponciāni, Blekmāra-Dīmera, Trompovska, Kolles, Taraša, Džobavas, Rihtera-Veresova,
    Bongklauda, Šēveningenas, Svešņikova, Najdorfa, Fegatello, Trakslera, Māršala, Šlīmaņa, Helovīna, Zēmiša,
    Falkbēra, Kīzerickis, Maroci, Mailza, Džuoko, Eive, Makkačens and the rest.
- Left as is:
  - piano and pianissimo (Džuoko) are read "pi-a-no", "pianisimo" (probe −0.93), as Latvian reads them. `pjāno` was
    heard "pijāno" 2 times in 3, no better.
  - Ouena is read "Auena" (probe −0.39; "Oena" +0.36); no Latvian spelling gives "ou".
  - Pterodaktiļa ties with and without its p (probe: "Terodaktiļa" −0.11, "Ptterodaktiļa" −0.07); it was heard
    "terodāk ceļu" once.
  - Van 't Kreisa is said "Vant Kreisa", as in Dutch (probe: "Van et" and "Vant" +0.32, "Van tē" +0.88).
  - After a word ending in a vowel ("bija ē četri", "vajag ē"), the long e still runs into that word 1 or 2
    times in 3.
- Recogniser habits: Whisper writes the voicing assimilation as heard (zirgs "zirks", tavs "taus"). Other habits:
  - "šaks" for šahs, "kā" for hā;
  - baltie as "Baltija", melnie as "mēlnie", gājiens as "gājens" or "gājienes";
  - the diphthong o as "uo" (noved "nuovēt", atdod "atduot", as said);
  - ņem joined to the next word ("zirgsņemēs"), and squares and numbers as notation;
  - English spellings for names (Fischer's, Fogbears, Grand Prix);
  - it often loses or garbles the first words of a line.

## Lithuanian

| Written | Voice said | Spoken spelling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| the file letter a (squares, "nuo a iki h") | after a vowel the short a melts into it: "valdove į a penki" heard "valdovėjo penki", "valdovėje 5" 3 times in 3, "nuo a iki ha" heard "nuo iki ha", "nuo ICH" 3 in 3 (the probe puts it next to "nuo iki ha") | `aa` (file.a.spoken, lesson.welcome.files.spoken), the long a of the letter's name: heard as the a-file 13 times in 18 over 6 contexts, against 10 in 21 (after "į" 4 in 6, against 0 in 6); "nuo aa iki ha" 2 in 3 |
| the file letter h (squares) | "ha" after a vowel loses its h: "langelio ha aštuoni" heard "langelio 8" 3 times in 3, "valdovė ha penki" heard "valdovė a penki" (probe: "langelio ha aštuoni" nearest "langelio a aštuoni", −0.02) | `haa` (file.h.spoken, lesson.welcome.files.spoken): the h heard 26 times in 33 over 10 contexts, against 10 in 30; `cha` did 11 in 15 but names the letter Ch |
| Hm, (before a sentence) | a vowel: heard "Ham", "Kam", "Hammasiu" (hummed 5 times in 12) | `hmm` (respell.hm): hummed 8 times in 12 |
| Nimco-indų | before the hyphen the c is read as k: nearest "Nimko-indų" (probe −0.00; −0.73 in a sentence), heard "nimko", "Niemko", "nebko" 6 times in 9. "Nimco" alone and "Nimco indų" keep ts | `nimtso` (respell.nimco): no k in 9 ("nems", "Niemcų-Indų"); the probe puts "Nimtso-indų" next to "Nimtso indų" (−0.02) |
| Grand Prix (ataka) | the d and the x said: in a sentence nearest "grand priks" (probe +1.15, `gran pri` +2.59); alone the name lasts 4 s, said in pieces | `gran`, `pri` (respell.grand, respell.prix), French as players say it: Whisper writes "Grand Prix" either way |

- Parakeet missed 95 % of the words on this voice; the main round trip is Whisper medium set to `lt`, 300 lines
  (seed 0, 50 % of 4,052 words missed even with the diacritics and y/i folded). Then 3 seeds on 93 lines (the
  reviewers' list, Hm against Hmm, 60 opening names in 30 pairs "Tavo debiutas – X, o mano atsakas – Y.", 36
  eponyms in lists, the file letters, the L, numbers), on 23 and 21 lines of A/B variants of the file letters
  a, e and h in 16 contexts and of Nimco, and on 8 lines of Torės and Trompovskio; probes (4 seeds) on about 90
  readings. The catalog already spells the foreign names the Lithuanian way (Šteinicas, Tarašas, Naidorfas,
  Džiuoko piano, Karo-Kano, Eivė, Mailso), so few needed anything.
- Checked and fine: Elo ("elo" 3 in 3), an pasan, mitelšpilis, endšpilis (the d melts into š, as in speech:
  "enšpilis"), el for the L ("raidę L", "el"), raidė e (probe: next to the long `ę`, the letter's name), Oi,
  Oho (probe: "O ho" −0.16), Matai (6 in 6), taisau, the letters cė and ef (heard C3, F6 3 in 3), bė, dė, gė (said, often run into the next word),
  the numbers (71 %, 92 %, 21, 11, 19, 122, 34-asis, 12-asis, "plius du kablelis trys", "minus vienas kablelis
  penki": the right digits). Džiuoko piano is read "pjano" (probe −0.16; `pjano` heard the same), Benoni with the
  stress on no (probe: `Benòni` −0.30). Pirco, Cukertorto, Horvico, Poncianio keep ts (probe: `Pirtso` +0.26,
  `Tsukertorto` +0.11, `Horvitso` +0.09) and Richterio, Aliochino, Šlechteris, šachas a fricative ch (probe
  nearest `Rihterio`, `šahas`; Aliochino far from `Aliokino`). Names heard as written: Karo-Kano, Blekmaro-Dimerio,
  Smito-Moros, Van Kruiso, Van Geto, Retio, Bongklaudo, Džobavos, Parhamo, Filidoro, Šventojo Jurgio, Helovino,
  Stafordo, Trakslerio, Zemišo, Ševeningeno, Šlimano, Kolės, Morfio, Naidorfo, Oveno, Rosolimo, Saragosos,
  Sokolskio, Svešnikovo, Taimanovo, Tarašo, Vinaverio, Čigorino, Griunfeldo, Hipopotamo, Falkbėro, Englundo,
  Evanso, Berdo, Borgo, Grobo, Alapino, Albino, Bogoliubovo, Benko, Maršalo, Merano, Panovo, Leningrado, Kano,
  Mailso, Fegatelo, and the eponyms (Šteinicas ... Botvinikas; Stauntonas is heard "Tontonas").
- Left as is: the file letter e is said (probe: "keturi" alone far) with the open Lithuanian e, which Whisper often
  writes "a" ("Akieturi" for "e keturi"); `ee` was heard worse ("ir katuri", "Jai"). ankstyvas, anksti, anksčiau
  are said with a g-like k (probe: `angstyvas` −0.37; heard "angstyvas", "angsti" every time): the voicing of a stop
  in a cluster, no other spelling. Torės and Trompovskio lean to u in the probe (`Turės` −0.02, `Trumpovskio`
  −0.42), but the probe does as much for Kolės (`Kulės` −0.03), which Whisper hears right; Torės is heard with an
  o 4 times in 6 outside "Tavo debiutas – Torės", `Toorės` was heard no better, and `Troompovskio` hardly
  (an o 3 times in 6, against 1 in 6): too few to keep. A word-initial r is weak ("Retis" heard "Lietis", "Vietis").
- Recogniser habits: Whisper writes ė as e or ie (ėjimas "ejimas", "eimas"; pėstininkas "piestininkas"), y as i
  (gynyba "ginyba"), ie as ė (juodieji "juodėjai", baltieji "baltėjai"), rikis as "reikis", "reikia", Sicilijos
  as "Sicilios", debiutas as "debütas", splits compounds ("balta laukis", "šiuo laikinė"), squares and numbers as
  notation, known names in their own spelling (Grand Prix, Marshall, Stafford, Traxler, Miles) and common words
  for rare names ("pirko" for Pirco, "turės" for Torės, "Trump" for Trompovskio), and drops or garbles a line's
  first word. The probe puts rikis, juodieji, ėjimas, šachas, langelyje, stovi, Sicilijos, siekia, lėta, laimi,
  italų, erdvės next to their written form.
